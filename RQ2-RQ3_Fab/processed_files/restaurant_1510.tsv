Caffè delle Rose Bistrot	via Ruga 36	Verbania	28922	Italy	€€	Mediterranean Cuisine	Occupying an early 20C building in the heart of Pallanza’s picturesque historic centre, this authentic bistro now has a young and contemporary feel. Run by Massimiliano Celeste, a talented chef who is very well known in the region, the restaurant specialises in Mediterranean cuisine prepared with a touch of imagination. There’s a small chef’s table in front of the kitchen, plus an old ice-house (now a small wine cellar housing some excellent wines) which is well worth visiting.

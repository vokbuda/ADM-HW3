PS Ristorante	via di Petriolo 7	Cerreto Guidi	50050	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary, Seasonal Cuisine	Situated in the beautiful countryside outside Cerreto Guidi, PS Ristorante is housed in the magnificent Medici Villa Petriolo which is also home to 36 luxurious guestrooms. The restaurant’s appeal is enhanced not only by the charm of the villa and its delightful garden (overlooked by the restaurant terrace), but also by the property’s delicious home-produced ingredients, such as extra-virgin olive oil, wine, Cinta Senese pork, meat and chicken, produce from the kitchen garden, traditional cereals and other zero-mile ingredients, all reinterpreted in a creative, modern style by the chef (as in the egg and artichoke dish). The estate’s wine is also highly recommended – we particularly enjoyed the organic red Golpaia, a medium-structured blend of Merlot and Sangiovese with characteristic soft aromas.

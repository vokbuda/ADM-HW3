Trattoria Pomposa - Al Re gras	via Castel Maraldo 57	Modena	41121	Italy	€	Emilian, Country cooking	It’s not just the affordable prices that will keep you coming back here, as the real highlight is its flavourful Emilian cuisine, which has been given a fresh, more modern twist. Among the first courses, we can recommend the tortellini in chicken broth or with a 24-month Parmesan cream; and for the main course, a delicious tripe with bread croutons. The Lambrusco is a must on the wine list here (we can recommend a good Grasparossa di Castelvetro). In the summer, meals are served outdoors on the small Piazza della Pomposa.

Al Palazzo	via Dei Mulini 23	Positano	84017	Italy	€€€	Mediterranean Cuisine, Classic Cuisine	Al Palazzo is the renowned restaurant at the Palazzo Murat hotel which is run by the Attanasio family. Dine alfresco in the restaurant’s beautiful botanical garden with its tiny vegetable patch, apart from on rare days of bad weather, when guests are served indoors in its small, elegant dining rooms. The Mediterranean cuisine includes meat and fish dishes alike, with slightly different menus at lunchtime (simpler options) and in the evening. Le Petit Murat bar is still open, offering an interesting selection of cocktails to supplement its excellent wine list.

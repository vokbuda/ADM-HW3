Feva	Borgo Treviso 62	Castelfranco Veneto	31033	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Seasonal Cuisine	Situated in the historic centre of Castelfranco Veneto, this restaurant has an intimate, elegant and contemporary-cum-minimalist feel despite its period courtyard setting and original wooden beams in the first-floor dining room. Nicola Dinato’s cuisine is showcased on two tasting menus, namely Anima and Corpo. The former offers a selection of new dishes created by the chef, who is constantly updating his cuisine, while the latter features his historic signature specialities (don’t miss the artichoke, crab, fig and leek dish). A lighter, less expensive menu is also available at lunchtime. The impressive wine list includes many French labels – unsurprisingly, perhaps, as the sommelier (and chef’s wife) is from France!

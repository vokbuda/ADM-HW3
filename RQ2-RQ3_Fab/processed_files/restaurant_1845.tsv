Osteria del Tempo Perso	via Gamba 12	Ravenna	48121	Italy	€€	Italian Contemporary, Italian	Situated in a hidden corner of the historic centre, this small bistro-style restaurant has a friendly and welcoming atmosphere, with photos alternating with books, wine bottles and glasses on the walls (the wine list includes a few labels from elsewhere in Europe). Small tables set close together, warm, subtle lighting and an almost Parisian ambience make this a perfect choice for a romantic dinner or a meal with friends. There’s also a small outdoor space for fine weather but seats are limited, so it’s best to book ahead!

53 Untitled	via del Monte della Farina 53	Rome	186	Italy	€€	Italian Contemporary	Situated in the heart of historic Rome not far from Piazza Navona, this small, simple restaurant with just a few tables serves excellent cuisine (booking ahead is recommended). Apart from a few classic dishes from Lazio, most of the options here are more creative, occasionally even with an Asian twist. The tapas-style “morsi e morsetti” (light bites) which head the menu can be ordered as appetisers or main courses, and are followed by a selection of pastas, salumi, cheeses and desserts.

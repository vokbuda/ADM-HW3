D'O	piazza della Chiesa 14, loc. San Pietro all'Olmo	Cornaredo	20007	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Italian Contemporary	Two of the three dining rooms at this restaurant overlook a charming square with an elm tree and 17C church. After two decades of hard, painstaking work on his own, combined with years of experience elsewhere (including early spells with top chefs such as Marchesi and Ducasse), chef Davide Oldani has by now developed his own precise, recognisable style and is an established personality in the world of Italian cuisine. His creative dishes are rooted in Italian traditions and showcase superlative technique, beautiful presentation and convincing flavours. Year after year, this chef fine-tunes his “pop” cuisine with a real focus on detail, as demonstrated by the workshop he has created for his flour and yeast products. Our inspector particularly praised the warm and cold Grana Padano served with caramelised onions – an exciting interpretation of an iconic dish!

Cortile Arabo	vicolo Villadorata	Marzamemi	96018	Italy	€€€	Contemporary, Sicilian	In one of Sicily’s most iconic fortified villages which once prospered as a tuna fishery and is now a popular tourist attraction, Cortile Arabo serves carefully prepared and occasionally elaborate dishes of the highest quality, with a focus on fish (the menu also features a few meat dishes). The terrace on the rocks overlooking the sea, where the sound of the waves provides a soothing backdrop, is one of the highlights here.

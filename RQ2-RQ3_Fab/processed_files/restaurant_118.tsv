Alle Ciaspole	località Plazze 4, frazione Tret	Fondo	38013	Italy	€€	Regional Cuisine, Classic Cuisine	The name of this excellent hotel-restaurant on the border with the Alto Adige region is a clear reference to the snowshoes used in winter excursions in Tret, as well as to the local traditions which inspire the cuisine created here by the owner-chef. Precise, classic cooking methods plus the use of locally sourced produce (with the exception of the fish dishes which also feature on the menu) are showcased in the cuisine, with dishes announced by the chef’s wife at your table in the unexpectedly elegant Alpine-style dining room.

Osteria de Börg	via Forzieri 12	Rimini	47921	Italy	€	Cuisine from Romagna, Traditional Cuisine	Borgo San Giuliano is situated just a stroll from the sea in old Rimini, a district of narrow alleyways and brightly painted houses that once provided homes for local fishermen. It is also home to this excellent osteria-style restaurant with an outdoor space on the small square for summer meals and two smart dining rooms decorated with rustic vintage furnishings. This is the setting for typical Romagna cuisine which features top-quality cured hams, fresh home-made pasta (don’t miss the cappelletti in chicken broth) and meat including Mora Romagnola pork in various dishes.

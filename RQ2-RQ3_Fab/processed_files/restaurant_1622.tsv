Hyle	contrada Torre Garga SS 107	San Giovanni in Fiore	87055	Italy	€€€€	Modern Cuisine, Calabrian	Located on the wooded Sila plateau famous since Greek times, this restaurant aims to take guests on a culinary voyage through the region, from the hills overlooking the sea to the high mountain peaks. Although spanning just a short distance, this covers a fertile area which boasts a rich diversity of ingredients. Enhanced by the experience of chef Antonio Biafora, the restaurant’s focus is on top-quality local produce (vegetables, aromatic herbs, walnuts etc) sourced from local farmers and growers, creating a chain which is both economic and socially responsible. In addition to its à la carte options, guests also have the choice of two tasting menus, the regional character of which is emphasised by their Calabrian names (PùzalyandChjùbica). The first, a seven-course menu, takes its name from the Greek word “pisseres” which means resinous, while the second refers to the ancient road that linked Paola to Cirò Marina and consists of eleven courses, all full of flavour. Excellent value for money!

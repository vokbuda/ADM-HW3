La Credenza	via Cavour 22	San Maurizio Canavese	10077	Italy	€€€	Creative	Three dining rooms with a modern atmosphere–one of which overlooking a small garden where in the summer there is room for just three tables, so book early if you want to eat outdoors, weather permitting–and a cuisine that starts from a Piedmont base to then wander off along more creative, sometimes even orientalizing paths. A remarkable wine cellar, approximately 1700 labels illustrated in two volumes in addition to which there is an extensive choice by the glass.

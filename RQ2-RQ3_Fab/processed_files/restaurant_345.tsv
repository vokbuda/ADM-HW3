Alessandro Mecca al Castello di Grinzane Cavour	via Castello 5	Grinzane Cavour	12060	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine	There’s no shortage of classic Piedmontese ingredients (such as anchovies, peppers and veal) on the menu at this restaurant, where traditional recipes are reinterpreted with a personalised and contemporary touch. Dishes from outside the region, including various fish-based options, also feature, while the restaurant aims to avoid food waste by using every single part of its ingredients where possible. The location in a splendid castle with 11C origins, once the home of Camillo Benso, count of Cavour, adds to the appeal.

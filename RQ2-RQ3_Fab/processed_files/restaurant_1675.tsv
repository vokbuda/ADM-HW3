Osteria Taviani	piazza Vittorio Emanuele II 28	Bientina	56031	Italy	€€	Tuscan, Modern Cuisine	This pleasant, warmly decorated restaurant is run with passion and enthusiasm by Elena and Alessandro, the former supervising the front of house, the latter at the helm in the kitchen. The cuisine here is modern and full of flavour, with a focus on meat dishes (although a few fish options also feature) with their roots firmly anchored in Tuscan traditions (such as the fried steak). During the hunting season, the contemporary-style game dishes are particularly delicious. The wine list includes a few French labels.

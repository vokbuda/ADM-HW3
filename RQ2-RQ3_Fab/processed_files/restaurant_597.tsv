Agli Amici Dopolavoro	isola delle Rose	Venice	30133	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Contemporary	You cross a small garden-cum-olive grove to get to this romantic and elegant restaurant situated on the enchanting Isola delle Rose, a private island accessible only by boat. Overseen by chef Emanuele Scarello, the resident chef here is the young and talented Lorenzo Lai who serves two tasting menus: “LagunAmare” features top-quality fish while the “Giardino delle Rose” is a vegetarian menu based on vegetables grown in the restaurant’s own garden. Both menus showcase the rich selection of produce available in the lagoon and the biodiversity of the island itself. On summer evenings, an aperitif on the charming outdoor terrace is highly recommended.

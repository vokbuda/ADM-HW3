Coltivare	borgata Brandini 16	La Morra	12064	Italy	€€€	Piedmontese, Traditional Cuisine	This small restaurant next to the Brandini winery has chef Luca Zecchin at its helm, a true connoisseur of Langhe culinary traditions and one of the more recent disciples of Lidia Alciati (known as the “queen” of Piedmontese cuisine). Nearly all the ingredients used here are sourced locally, some even from the property itself, such as eggs and vegetables from the kitchen garden. The dishes are divided between those which pay tribute to the traditions of the region (don’t miss the “plin”) and others which showcase the chef’s personal style, including a menu dedicated to the barbecue grill. The latter is even used in some of the sweets, such as the smoky-flavoured bread and chocolate dessert. The wine list demonstrates the same affection for Piedmont, as well as featuring a selection of champagnes. During the day, enjoy the splendid view through the picture windows that surround the dining room, which also boasts a large fireplace.

La Favellina	via Cosari 4/6, località San Tomio	Malo	36034	Italy	€€€€	Italian Contemporary, Creative	Signora Gianello fell in love with this delightful late-19C hamlet surrounded by the green hills north of Vicenza and bought a restaurant here, which she has renovated in an elegant, feminine style. She now runs the restaurant with her two sons: Riccardo front of house and Federico in the kitchen with his mother (the latter responsible for the delicious first courses!). The cuisine here is predominantly contemporary Italian, prepared from top-quality ingredients often sourced from the area immediately around the restaurant. Sweet chestnuts, virgin olive oil, strawberry tree berries, aromatic and even wild herbs are gathered personally by the chefs from the local area. Simple, modern cuisine which is full of flavour.

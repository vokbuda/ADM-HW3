Trattoria Antichi Sapori	via Montanara 318	Gaione	43124	Italy	â‚¬	Emilian, Traditional Cuisine	Just a few kilometres outside the town and yet already in open countryside, this typical local trattoria offers a simple yet warm and friendly ambience and excellent cuisine focused on regional specialities. The stuffed pasta and veal brisket are two of the dishes that we enjoyed the most here.

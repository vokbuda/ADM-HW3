Al Paradiso	via Sant'Ermacora 1	Paradiso di Pocenia	33050	Italy	€€	Regional Cuisine	A small gem of a restaurant housed in an old farmhouse adorned with beautiful drapes and decorations. Although there’s a new chef here, the long family tradition of regional cuisine (mainly meat dishes and game) remains unchanged, with a large spit for roasting meat in the fireplace in the main dining room.

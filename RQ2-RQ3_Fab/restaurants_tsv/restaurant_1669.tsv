La Gioconda	via Brancuti	Cagli	61043	Italy	€	Country cooking, Modern Cuisine	Situated in the heart of the historic centre, this restaurant pays tribute to the Cagli region and the Marche hinterland. Dishes feature the best local ingredients, such as truffles in season (both black and white), as well as a dessert in memory of local sculptor Eliseo Mattiacci (the “fabbrica del cosmo” made with yoghurt, wafers and strawberries). The wine list shows a strong preference for the Marche, but also features wines from further afield.

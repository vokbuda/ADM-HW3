Locanda Sensi	località Case Negri 116	Rivergaro	29029	Italy	€€	Italian Contemporary, Modern Cuisine	We highly recommend this pleasant country restaurant run by friendly and enthusiastic staff, where the owner appears frequently in the dining room. The ambience is modern and comfortable, the outdoor dining area boasts typical views of the Piacenza hills, and – last but not least – the food is excellent! The options on the fine-dining menu range from regional specialities to fish-based dishes, as well as various delicacies cooked on the barbecue grill, such as pigeon breast (served with pigeon leg, marinated breast, offal and rice timbale). The wine selection is also excellent.

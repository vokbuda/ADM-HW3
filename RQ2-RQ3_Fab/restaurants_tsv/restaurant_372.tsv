Due Camini	Strada Comunale Egnazia	Savelletri	72015	Italy	€€€€	Mediterranean Cuisine, Creative	This is the most romantic restaurant in the Borgo Egnazia resort, where the soft candlelight creates a hushed, magical atmosphere that makes it perfect for a special occasion, dinner with a loved one, or simply a gourmet meal. Enjoy excellent service as you embark on a gastronomic journey that introduces you to specialities from chef Domingo Schingaro’s Puglia, dishes inspired by the region, and recipes influenced by the wider Mediterranean (depending on the menu). Many of the ingredients are sourced from the hotel’s own kitchen garden.

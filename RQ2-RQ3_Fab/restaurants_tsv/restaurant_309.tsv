Controcorrente	via Colombo 101	Noli	17026	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine, Ligurian	In this minimalist restaurant, situated below the medieval San Giovanni tower in the picturesque pedestrianised historic centre of Noli, the owner-chef serves contemporary cuisine that echoes the dining room’s modern decor. The menu features meat and fish dishes alike, all prepared from almost exclusively Ligurian ingredients, including delicious purple Sanremo prawn tartare with celery mayonnaise, lemon cream and plankton chips, as well as lamb cooked in its own juices with Albenga artichokes.

Villa Maiella	via Sette Dolori 30, località Villa Maiella	Guardiagrele	66016	Italy	€€€	Cuisine from Abruzzo, Modern Cuisine	Way back in 1966, Ginetta and Arcangelo probably never dreamed for a moment that their modest tavern would become so famous. Nowadays, the Tinari family comprises mother-and-son Angela and Arcangelo in the kitchen, and Peppino and Pascal front of house, all of whom offer guests a warm welcome in their restaurant on the edge of the Parco della Maiella. Here, you’ll enjoy authentic Abruzzo dishes with the occasional surprising and creative twist on three tasting menus (chosen when you make your booking). A good choice also for beer-lovers, with over a thousand different labels available including a wide selection by the glass.

Stefano Paganini alla Corte degli Alfieri	piazza Raimondo 2	Magliano Alfieri	12050	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine	Occupying a superb 17C castle, this restaurant has two dining rooms: one is decorated with works by local artists which change throughout the year, while the other, more romantic in feel, is adorned with roses and boasts splendid frescoed ceilings. There’s no choice here, just a tasting menu (although guests can select just a few courses if they wish), but the cuisine is of excellent quality and offers good value for money.

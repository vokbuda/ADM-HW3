Enoteca Del Duca	via di Castello 2	Volterra	56048	Italy	€€	Classic Cuisine, Tuscan	Despite the change of ownership at this centrally located restaurant right behind the castle and the main square, there’s a certain continuity to the cuisine which remains focused on classic dishes with a regional flavour (with the option of steak on the menu). The dining room features old stone walls, plus there’s also an attractive outdoor space for summer dining.

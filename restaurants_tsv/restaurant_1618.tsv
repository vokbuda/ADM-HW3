Le Bistrot	via Roma 87	Courmayeur	11013	Italy	€€€	Contemporary, Creative	In the refined rooms of Grand Hotel Royal e Golf, the dining room with its glass wall looks like a stage overlooking the chain of Monte Bianco and Dente del Gigante. The gastronomic proposal is one of the most appealing in the area: creative rather than local, the dishes are refined and technically elaborate.

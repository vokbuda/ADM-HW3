Radici Osteria Contemporanea	via Giuseppe Mazzini 13	Gallarate	21013	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine	Having moved to the pedestrianised section of historic Gallarate, Radici Osteria Contemporanea has also adopted a new look, with a lounge-bar ambience that is young and trendy, making it the perfect setting for its aperitifs and superb cocktails. The restaurant’s excellent, modern and personalised cuisine remains unchanged, however.

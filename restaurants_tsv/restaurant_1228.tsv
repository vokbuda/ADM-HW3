La Pineta	via Gualco 82, località Struppa	Genoa	16165	Italy	€€	Traditional Cuisine, Meats and Grills	Now a gastronomic institution in the city, in a secluded setting immersed in nature, La Pineta occupies the ground floor of a nondescript building in which the simple, “dated” yet comfortable decor provides the backdrop. Although there is a menu (but no wine list), the dishes are usually announced in person at your table by the owners. Simple, traditional and abundant cuisine which is mainly cooked on the open grill in the centre of the room, including meat (its signature speciality) and fish.

Il Gusto di Xinge	Viale Belfiore 2	Florence	50144	Italy	€€	Asian Contemporary, Dim Sum	The dining room at this restaurant is decorated in brown tones reminiscent of a teapot, brightened here and there by dashes of blue and modern leather chairs. The Chinese chef serves cuisine from his native country (including dim sum), while also remaining open to influences from France and Italy. Inspired by the Chinese book of the same name, the Dream of Red Chambers dish (lychee-shaped balls filled with shrimp and melted cheese) is particularly recommended by our inspector.

Radimare	via Beato Piergiorgio Frassati 5/a	Monopoli	70043	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine, Mediterranean Cuisine	There’s no tasting menu at this restaurant but instead a tempting à la carte featuring modern Mediterranean cuisine based on top-quality seasonal ingredients, with fish and seafood taking centre stage. Citrus fruit and a few spices, especially ginger, are used carefully and sparingly, as are aromatic herbs which add a touch of fresh flavour to the dishes. The contemporary decor, enhanced by plants and a profusion of wood, plus friendly service add to the appeal.

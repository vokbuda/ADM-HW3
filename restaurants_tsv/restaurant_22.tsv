Joca	vico Sospiri 10/C	Naples	80121	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine	In a modern, trendy setting, chef Gianluca D'Agostino prepares creative gourmet cuisine with the occasional Campanian influence. In addition to this, in a separate part of the restaurant, guests can choose from a selection of tapas-style dishes which, despite the name, are inspired by traditional Italian and regional classics and have little to do with Spain. The gourmet menu features successful dishes such as sweetbreads, fettuccine and cod, as well as pasta with peas. The main courses include meat and fish.

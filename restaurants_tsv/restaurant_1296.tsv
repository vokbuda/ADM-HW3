Nello	Via IV Novembre 66	San Casciano in Val di Pesa	50026	Italy	€€	Italian Contemporary, Tuscan	Michele, in the kitchen, and pastry chef Chiara, who also works front of house, have renovated this historic local address and transformed it into a restaurant offering a modern interpretation of Tuscan cuisine. On the varied and intriguing menu, you’ll find dishes such as the intense and highly technical ravioli filled with Parmesan cream (made with milk from Reggiana “red cows”) with chanterelle mushrooms and onions. The concise wine list focuses on nearby Chiantis but also includes bottles from elsewhere.

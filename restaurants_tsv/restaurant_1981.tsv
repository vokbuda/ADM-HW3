Café Les Paillotes	piazza Le Laudi 2	Pescara	65129	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Seafood	This old acquaintance of the Michelin Guide now has a new chef at the helm! Although the decor and furnishings remain the same with a slightly old-fashioned feel, the cuisine is modern yet with no unnecessary frills and has a fresh and generous flavour. Highlights on the menu include the new raw fish options, which have an entire tasting menu to themselves. The well-stocked wine cellar is home to around 500 labels which offer good value for money.

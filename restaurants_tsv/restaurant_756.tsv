La Filanda	via Marsala 8	Manciano	58014	Italy	€€	Tuscan, Modern Cuisine	Situated in the heart of the historic centre, this restaurant occupies an old spinning mill ("filanda")  that has been completely restored without losing any of its original charm. Here, self-taught chef Barbara serves traditional dishes reinterpreted with real flair, such as the involtino di ciaffagnone filled with Maremma beef on a bed of melted pecorino cheese and crispy leek. The chef’s husband oversees the wine list, which includes a selection of Tuscan labels.

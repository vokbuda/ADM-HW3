Tana de 'l Ors	via Roma 28	Forno di Zoldo	32012	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine, Farm to table	A favourite with food-lovers, this restaurant serves lighter meals at lunchtime which are nonetheless carefully and imaginatively prepared (don’t miss theorsoburger!). In the evening, the best daily ingredients are prepared with a lightly modern touch – meat is the undisputed start of the show, although a few fish dishes also feature. One-room and two-room apartments are also available.	[]	['Credit card / Debit card accepted', ' Mastercard credit card', ' Visa credit card']	+39 0437 794097	https://www.tanadelors.it

Ostaria Pignatelli	Riviera di Chiaia 216	Naples	80121	Italy	€	Campanian	Situated near the neo-Classical Villa Pignatelli and in front of the Villa Comunale gardens, this restaurant offers an outdoor space as well as an elegant taverna-style dining room. “La vita è una, mangiala” (which roughly translates as “you have only one life, so make the most of it!”) is the restaurant’s motto and it’s not difficult to oblige given the delicious cuisine served here. The menu features an extraordinary array of classic favourites from Campania, all full of overwhelming flavours, including aubergine parmigiana, fried anchovies, mixed pasta with potatoes and Provola cheese, “candele alla Genovese” (pasta with beef ragu), Neapolitan-style cod and various lemon desserts.

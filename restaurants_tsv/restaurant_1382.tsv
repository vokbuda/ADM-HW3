Reale	contrada Santa Liberata, località Casadonna	Castel di Sangro	67031	Italy	€€€€	Modern Cuisine, Creative	Housed in a 16C monastery amid gardens and vineyards in the foothills surrounding Castel di Sangro, this restaurant boasts a simple, minimalist style which is echoed in its cuisine, created by one of the most easily identified and recognisable chefs in Italy. For years, Niko Romito has been renowned for his minimalist-style dishes which are prepared from just a few ingredients, featuring sauces with an Italian rather than classically French flavour, and this remarkable chef continues to research and evolve. He focuses on ingredients and recipes from his native Abruzzo, paying particular attention to vegetables and creating dishes that are striking for their intense flavours. As ever, his dishes are apparently simple yet often the result of complex preparation that leaves his guests full of spellbound admiration.

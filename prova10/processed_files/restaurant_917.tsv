Vineria Modì	via Calapitrulli 13	Taormina	98039	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary, Sicilian	Situated in the historic centre of Taormina, this restaurant started out as a wine-bar which explains its name as well as the extensive wine list featuring over 1 000 different labels. Today, the wine accompanies fine cuisine prepared by a skilful female chef, whose brother oversees the front of house. Creative and elaborate dishes with a Sicilian flavour (as well as influences from elsewhere) are served in an elegant dining room and in an attractive outdoor space on the pedestrianised street.

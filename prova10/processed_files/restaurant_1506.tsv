Da Vittorio	via Cantalupa 17	Brusaporto	24060	Italy	€€€€	Italian Contemporary	"Although there’s an à la carte at this welcoming, family-run restaurant, the four tasting menus served here are the highlight: “Gli esordi di papà Vittorio” (traditionally inspired meat dishes); “Dalla nostra campagna” (vegetables grown in the restaurant’s own kitchen garden and at Planet Farm); “Carta Bianca” (16 courses showcasing the chef’s creative skills to the full); and “Nella tradizione di Vittorio"" (8 fish and seafood courses prepared with fresh produce from the market, including the famous “pacchero” or mantis shrimp). All the dishes are prepared using carefully chosen, top-quality ingredients and are striking for their beautiful presentation and rich, intense and traditional flavours. At Vittorio, guests are carefully looked after from start to finish, with the extraordinary cheese and dessert trolleys providing a fitting finale."

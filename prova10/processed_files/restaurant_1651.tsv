Cala Luna	via Vincenzo Cavallaro 12	Cefalu	90015	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary, Sicilian	The elegant fine-dining restaurant at Le Calette boutique hotel, Cala Luna boasts an attractive dining room (Rizz'i Mari) where meals are served in low season, as well as an open-air garden on Via Presidiana for summer dining where, just like the dining room, the views take in the Caldura rocks and the La Rocca outcrop, albeit from a slightly different perspective. Chef Dario Pandolfo uses creative techniques acquired during his time working at renowned restaurants, which he applies to Sicilian ingredients and traditions. The result is exciting and colourful cuisine which is creative and full of Mediterranean flavours.

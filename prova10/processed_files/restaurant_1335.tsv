Materia | Spazio Cucina	via Teatro Massimo 29	Catania	95131	Italy	€€	Sicilian, Modern Cuisine	The entrance to this restaurant is typical of an old residential-style building, giving the impression that you are stepping into the chef’s own home. Here, the beautiful dining room boasts shared tables and an entire wall covered with shelves of jars containing dried fruit, pumpkin seeds and red lentils. The classic-style cuisine focuses on grilled dishes and modern cooking methods to create typical Sicilian meat and fish dishes that pay careful attention to the seasons. The first courses are excellent, including the spaghetti with butter and anchovies, which is served with Favignana tuna bottarga and muddica atturrata(spiced breadcrumbs) made from Perciasacchi flour.

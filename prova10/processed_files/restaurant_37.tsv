Innesti	via San Pietro 8	Pergine Valsugana	38057	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine, Creative	Daniele and Elisa are a couple of young restaurateurs who are familiar to us from their time at Blumenstube in Sant'Orsola. Having moved on, they have now opened their own restaurant in Pergine, where both the decor and the cuisine are contemporary-Alpine in style. As in currently in vogue, their dishes are showcased on three tasting menus (short, medium and long) from which dishes can also be chosen à la carte style. All the recipes have a creative feel, demonstrating the chef’s playful approach to his contemporary ingredients.

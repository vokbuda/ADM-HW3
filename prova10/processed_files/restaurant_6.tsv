Da Bob Cook Fish	largo Parsano vecchio 16	Sorrento	80067	Italy	€€	Seafood	Working in partnership with the nearby fishmongers which supplies it with fresh fish and seafood, this restaurant occupies a building once used for storing oranges that dates back 400 years. Although there is a menu, given the restaurant’s close relationship with the fishmongers we recommend asking the serving staff about the catch of the day and taking a look in the glass cabinet where the fish are displayed. Dishes are classic and traditional, allowing the full flavour of the fresh fish to shine through.

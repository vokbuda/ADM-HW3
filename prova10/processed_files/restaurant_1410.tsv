Osteria Contemporanea	via Francesco Mattai 4	Gattinara	13045	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary	Housed in an old butcher’s shop right in the village centre, this intimate and elegantly simple “osteria” is run by a young couple. In the kitchen, Agnese Loss, who was born in 2001, has already acquired significant experience since leaving catering school. She creates personal and carefully prepared cuisine with real passion, with one menu that is dedicated exclusively to offal (all we’ll say about this is that we particularly enjoyed the tongue and sweetbreads – we’ll leave it to you to find out how these dishes were prepared!). The other two tasting menus (to be ordered by the whole table) reflect her own tastes, as well as those of her partner Davide, who runs the front of house with elegance and competence, including overseeing the wine list. A la carte options are also available.

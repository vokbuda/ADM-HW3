San Giorgio	via Mancini 3	Umbertide	6019	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine	Situated in the historic centre of Umbertide, beneath two arches in the main square where a monastery once stood, this restaurant serves personalised and modern cuisine in its three dining rooms and a small courtyard near the entrance. Presented on various tasting menus and an à la carte, the generously portioned dishes focus exclusively on meat (white and red) and offer excellent value for money. We particularly enjoyed the hearty and original “Pensando a un vitello tonnato” (literally “Thinking of a veal tonnato”). The friendly and knowledgeable sommelier is on hand to help with your wine choices.

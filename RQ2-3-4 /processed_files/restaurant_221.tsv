50 Kalò	piazza Sannazzaro 201/b	Naples	80122	Italy	€	Pizza	In the Neapolitan tradition of interpreting dreams, 50 means bread (dough), while the word “kalò” has Greek origins and means good – the name “good dough” explains the secret behind the pizzas made by Ciro Salvo, one of the most famous pizza masters in Naples. This chef makes traditional Neapolitan pizzas, which are large in size and have a soft dough. The restaurant doesn’t take reservations – if it’s busy you just leave your name and wait to be called. However, if you prefer not to wait, there’s a second restaurant at 2, Piazza della Repubblica where you can book ahead of time.

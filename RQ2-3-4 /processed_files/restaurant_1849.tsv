Locanda del Pilone	frazione Madonna di Como 34	Alba	12051	Italy	€€€	Creative	Situated just a few kilometres from the town, this restaurant stands on a hill with 360° views of some of the most breathtaking vineyard scenery in the area, where vines stand in neat rows extending into the distance and take on extraordinary colours in autumn. Here, in a classic and elegant setting, the cuisine features seasonally inspired dishes (on a tasting menu which can be mixed and matched à la carte style) created by a skilful and enthusiastic chef who has solid experience despite his relative youth. In summer, bistro options are also available on the splendid outdoor terrace.

Iyo Kaiseki	piazza Alvar Aalto 9N02	Milan	20124	Italy	€€€	Japanese, Sushi	Situated in the heart of Porta Nuova, the most modern district of Milan and an area that “is liked by people who are liked” (to use the words of an old advertising slogan), this restaurant occupies the first floor of the Torre Solaria. Take a seat in a dining room full of charm, where stone, wood and glass combine to create a warm, elegant and designer-style ambience. Chef Takeshi Iwai’s cuisine is hard to define, combining Italian and Japanese flavours in fusion-style dishes that embrace influences from both countries. The best option here is to savour the different dishes served on the tasting menus. The IYO Omakase sushi bar (a “restaurant within a restaurant”) shares an entrance with AALTO, although the two spaces are kept separate, and the food served at the bar is prepared by sushi master Masashi Suzuki.

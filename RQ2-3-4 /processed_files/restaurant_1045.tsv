Contaminazioni Restaurant	via San Sossio 2	Somma Vesuviana	80049	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary, Japanese	It’s worth pointing out from the outset that the dishes served at this restaurant on the slopes of Vesuvius are a far cry from the classic, traditional cuisine of Campania. Here, young chef Giuseppe Molaro offers surprise tasting menus of varying lengths, drawing on his experience working outside Italy, particularly in Japan, where he developed a passion for the cuisine of that country (and not just sushi). His dishes combine Japanese influences with local flavours to create dishes that are sometimes challenging (fermented or acidic flavours occasionally dominate) yet are perfect for anyone keen to try bold, innovative and experimental recipes.

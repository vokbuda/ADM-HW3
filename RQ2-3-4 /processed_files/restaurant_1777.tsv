I Salotti	Località Querce al Pino, SS 146	Chiusi	53043	Italy	€€€€	Creative	In summer, the outdoor spaces at this restaurant, such as the garden gazebo, are the perfect setting for a candlelit dinner in total harmony with nature, while in winter, the elegant dining room with just a few tables (book well in advance) really comes into its own. Creative cuisine prepared using produce from the restaurant’s own farm, plus a long-established wine cellar that has been extended over the years so that it now boasts over two thousand different labels from the region and elsewhere in Italy, many of them of the highest quality.

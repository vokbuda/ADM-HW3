Anna Stuben	via Vidalong 3	Ortisei	39046	Italy	€€€€	Creative	Although many brilliant “Anna’s” have cooked in this family-run restaurant over the years, for the past ten years there has been a superb male chef – Reimund Brunner – at the helm. The romantic ambience of the two Stube-style dining rooms is now famous, having become one of the places that you want to visit every time you return to the Val Gardena. The cuisine is inspired by the Alto Adige, yet also remains open to ingredients from further afield, including fish and seafood, in dishes which are lighter and fresh in style with a reduced use of butter and sugar. The service is excellent and highly attentive to guests’ needs, while the talented sommelier is always on hand to offer recommendations with a smile. Last but not least, the restaurant is housed within the Alpine-style Grödnerhof Hotel & Spa, which offers classically elegant guestrooms which pay little heed to passing trends.

Regallo	via Tollegno 4	Biella	13900	Italy	€€€	Seafood	Situated slightly on the outskirts, this contemporary-style restaurant occupies the unusual setting of an old factory. Here, picture windows in the dining room overlook the stream below, with the sound of the water adding an almost musical note to the ambience. In the open-view kitchen, skilful chef Claudio Ravinetto prepares dishes with an exclusive focus on fish, including delicious house specialities such as scallops with anchovy cream, tomatoes and basil, and the “Sicilia” dessert which pays tribute to the island with its ricotta cream topped with chocolate shavings, orange jelly and dried capers.

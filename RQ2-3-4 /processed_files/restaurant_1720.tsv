Aqua Crua	piazza Calcalusso 11/a	Barbarano Vicentino	36048	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Contemporary	Welcome to the wonderful world of chef Giuliano Baldessari, a creative chef who enjoys introducing guests to his gastronomic world. There are two dining options here: the tasting menus showcase the chef’s creativity and precise techniques to the full in courses referred to as “provocazioni”, which focus on the use of just a few ingredients per dish. The second option is the à la carte, which features dishes that demonstrate the generous, classic flavours of the 1980s – for example, the main ingredient in these dishes is often served with an array of small bowls containing accompanying ingredients. The service is also more classic in feel, involving the addition of table linen and period-style glasses, plates and even chairs. Both options, of course, are created by the same chef with the same intention, which is to guide guests through an amusing culinary playground in which boredom and banality have been completely banished. It’s no coincidence that the background music is accompanied by a pleasant play of colourful effects.

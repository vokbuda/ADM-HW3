Osteria la Fefa	via Trento-Trieste 9/c	Finale Emilia	41034	Italy	€€	Emilian, Traditional Cuisine	The name “Fefa” is a diminutive of Genoveffa, the female owner who founded this restaurant almost a century ago. Today, the new generation provides streamlined service, decidedly Emilian cuisine and careful attention to wine thanks to talented sommelier Edoardo, who is equally at home recommending a French Côtes-du-Rhône as he is with local Sangiovese labels – the extensive wine list (an entire page is dedicated to magnum bottles) will definitely impress wine-enthusiasts. The “primi” are delicious (don’t miss the classic tortellino in Parmesan cream), as are the “secondi”, which include sweet and sour duck leg in a Lambrusco sauce.

Meraviglioso Osteria Moderna	largo Gelso 16	Polignano a Mare	70044	Italy	€€€	Contemporary, Seafood	This attractive, welcoming modern restaurant stands in Polignano’s main street, scene of the town’s evening “passeggiata”, not far from the statue of the great Domenico Modugno, a native of this beautiful town. Although the lunch menu is simple in style, it is still inspired by fresh fish and seafood, while in the evening the young yet experienced chef creates more imaginative and inventive fare. There’s a convenient private car park nearby: if you want to take advantage of this, make sure you advise the restaurant of your arrival time.

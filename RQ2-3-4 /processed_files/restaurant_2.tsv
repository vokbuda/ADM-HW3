DA_MÓ	Via Bruno Buozzi 20	Matera	75100	Italy	€€	Regional Cuisine, Contemporary	This new, restored restaurant in the upper part of the Sassi (yet still near the centre of Matera and its car parks) has a warm friendly ambience and boasts a small, charming outdoor space. Here, an entire family (father in the kitchen, mother and daughter front of house), who moved to Matera from Venosa (home of the Latin poet Horatio), serves regional cuisine with a contemporary twist and no little skill and professionalism. Various tasting menus are available, as well as an à la carte. An interesting wine list completes the picture.

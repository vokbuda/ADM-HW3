Antica Corona Reale	via Fossano 13	Cervere	12040	Italy	€€€€	Piedmontese, Modern Cuisine	Situated between the Langhe and Monviso, this long-established restaurant celebrated its 200th anniversary a few years ago. Run by the Vivalda family for five generations, the restaurant started out as a dairy farm before gaining a well-earned reputation for its cuisine. Owner-chef Gian Piero Vivalda (Passion Dessert Award 2024) creates top-quality menus featuring expertly prepared, colourful and aromatic dishes. Popular with food-lovers from Italy and abroad, Cervere is also a point of reference for many local businesses who supply the restaurant with capon, guinea fowl, veal, Carmagnola peppers, porcini mushrooms and much more besides. The menu offers an array of enticing flavours, with modern dishes featuring alongside classic favourites, including a delicate raviolo of bagna càuda served with legendary bouillabaisse, which has made a reappearance on the menu after guests’ insistent requests. In summer, dine alfresco in the shade of a beautiful pergola among colourful flowers and a small fountain. Two small private rooms are available for intimate dinners, one of which is in the wine cellar surrounded by legendary bottles of wine. There’s also a small shop selling cakes and biscuits.

Li Galli	viale Pasitea 318	Positano	84017	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary, Italian Contemporary	This restaurant housed within the elegant Villa Franca hotel in the upper part of Positano boasts a small, bright dining room with distinctive black marble tables (just seven of them!), a glass ceiling and floor-to-ceiling windows that open in summer to create an outdoor dining space. The beautiful view looks out to sea and Li Galli, the island after which the restaurant is named. Following the end of the restaurant’s partnership with Nino Di Costanzo, chef Savio Perna (originally from Torre del Greco) now steps into the spotlight on his own. He takes his inspiration mainly from the local region, although the pigeon in one of his more interesting dishes is sourced from one of the best breeders in Tuscany. Much of Perna’s technique focuses on beautiful presentation and a light touch, while the excellent service also adds to guests’ overall enjoyment of the dining experience. The trolleys that display a selection of olive oils, excellent bread and a choice of tempting desserts are also worth a special mention. The wine list practically spans the globe with around 1 000 different labels – France and Italy take centre stage, with a focus on champagne (especially Krug), with many wines also available by the glass.

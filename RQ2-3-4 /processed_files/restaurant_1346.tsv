Krèsios	via San Giovanni 59	Telese	82037	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Contemporary	This old country house is the setting for some of the region’s most innovative cuisine. There’s no choice here, just one long surprise tasting menu with many courses that takes guests on a fast-paced and exciting culinary voyage. Although some of the dishes are inspired by Campanian traditions, the menu features flavours from around the world, recreating often little-known Italian and international recipes with a personalised twist. Chef Giuseppe Iannotti always succeeds in surprising his guests, thanks to his ingredients, cooking techniques and stunning presentations. A selection of wines from small-scale producers completes the picture – after all, Krèsios is simply another name for Bacchus.

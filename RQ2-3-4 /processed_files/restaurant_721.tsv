Al Metrò	via Magellano 35	San Salvo Marina	66050	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Mediterranean Cuisine	Housed in what was once the family pastry shop, this gourmet restaurant run by the Fossaceca brothers is minimalist, contemporary and almost neutral in style so that nothing detracts the attention from Nicola’s delicious cuisine (the outdoor space in a small square has a livelier ambience). The chef uses modern techniques to create carefully thought-out recipes that showcase the flavours of his mainly local ingredients to the full (including some of the best fish from the Adriatic) without fuss or unnecessary frills. The naturally leavened bread is made from Abruzzo flour (Senatore Cappelli and spelt) and is always excellent, as are the superb breadsticks made from Solina mountain corn. The restaurant has recently added an incredible coffee menu that includes top-quality coffees from across the globe.

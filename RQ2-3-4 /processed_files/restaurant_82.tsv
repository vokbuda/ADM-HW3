Abbruzzino	via Fiume Savuto, località Santo Janni	Catanzaro	88100	Italy	€€€	Country cooking, Contemporary	Having opened new premises in Lamezia Terme (Abbruzzino Oltre), this restaurant has retained young chef Antonio Fazio (who practically grew up here) at the helm at this address, where he continues to offer dishes that perfectly combine creativity with Calabrian traditions. This remains an excellent choice for anyone in search of regional cuisine reinterpreted with a contemporary twist. Front of house, the service overseen by the chef’s parents Antonio and Rosa is both friendly and professional. The impressive wine list is also influenced by the family’s love for the region, with one section completely dedicated to local labels, and another that focuses on wines from elsewhere in Italy and further afield. We particularly enjoyed the many delicious appetisers, as well as the rice with peas, pecorino and oysters, and the house signature dessert (bread, oil and sugar), which always features on the menu. Choose from two surprise tasting menus and a small à la carte.

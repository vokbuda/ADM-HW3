l' Ciocio - Osteria di Suvereto	piazza dei Giudici 1	Suvereto	57028	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine, Tuscan	Although this restaurant in the historic centre of Suvereto has the welcoming ambience of a traditional trattoria, its cuisine is more creative and elaborate in style (while still offering a few Tuscan classics). One of the house favourites is the “reale familiare”: a delicious cut of beef served with capers and anchovies.

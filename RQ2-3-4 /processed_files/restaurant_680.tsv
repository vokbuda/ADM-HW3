Il Sogno	via Vetrego 8	Vetrego	30035	Italy	€€	Country cooking, Traditional Cuisine	This restaurant (once a cultural club) in the Miranese countryside serves simple yet delicious cuisine at reasonable prices. Although the dishes have their roots in the region, they are also influenced by Slow Food traditions from elsewhere in Italy and further afield and boast the occasional personalised touch. In winter, the trolley of boiled meats served with sauces and mostarda makes an appearance.

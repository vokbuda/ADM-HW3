Impronte	via Cristoforo Baioni 38	Bergamo	24123	Italy	€€€€	Modern Cuisine, Mediterranean Cuisine	To describe this restaurant as a corner of Sicily in Bergamo would be a cliché, as the menu offers so much more. However, there’s no hiding chef Cristian Fagone’s Sicilian origins, which are evident in his convincing reinterpretations of some of the island’s classic recipes, including its street food (such as the grilled “stigghiola” made from intestines) and main courses such as the superb lamb. The restaurant is housed in a converted bus depot, which has been transformed into a modern, vaguely post-industrial dining room. Excellent service, especially from young sommelier Francesco, completes the picture.

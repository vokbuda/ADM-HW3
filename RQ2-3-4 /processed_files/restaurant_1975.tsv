Locanda 53 Supper Club	via Vergolano 53	Arco	38062	Italy	€€€	Contemporary	Partners in life and business, Evelyn and Carlo are a young couple who have settled in Arco’s old town where they have restored this old inn, embellishing it with three modern and comfortable guestrooms. The restaurant offers two tasting menus featuring meat or fish – guests are asked to make their choice when booking. Once that’s done, all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the intimate atmosphere of the couple’s small “supper club” and leave everything to the talented Evelyn in the kitchen and skilful Carlo front of house. The recipes here are modern yet unfussy, with a focus on carefully selected ingredients that are prepared with respect and real attention to detail. Fine cuisine and an exquisite welcome combine to offer a truly memorable dining experience.

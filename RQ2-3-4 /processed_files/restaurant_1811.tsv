Repubblica di Perno	vicolo Cavour 5, loc. Perno	Monforte d'Alba	12065	Italy	€€	Piedmontese	Situated in the heart of the gastronomic Langa region, this small, renovated restaurant in the centre of town (reservations required) is imbued with the passion of the couple at the helm (he’s in the kitchen, while she’s front of house). In keeping with Piedmontese tradition, you catch a glimpse of the open-view kitchen as you make your way to the first floor, which is laid out with just five tables. Enjoy traditional cuisine in a rustic, bistro-style setting where the daily menu showcases dishes with a strictly regional focus. Three guestrooms are also available.

Opificio	via Roma 131	Noventa Padovana	35027	Italy	€€€	Contemporary, Meats and Grills	A modern restaurant in the province of Padova which, over the past ten years, has grown and evolved from a gastro pub to the top-quality eatery that it is today. The cuisine is fairly eclectic, featuring meat and fish dishes alike, with the option of a lighter menu at lunchtime. The best dishes are showcased on the à la carte and are often made using luxury ingredients such as foie gras, scampi and Wagyu beef. The impressive wine list demonstrates a passion for international sparkling wines, while the excellent selection of wines by the glass is further enhanced by a choice of cocktails (also available at midday).

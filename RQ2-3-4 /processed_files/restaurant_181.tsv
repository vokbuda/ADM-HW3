Casa Rispoli	piazza san Francesco 7	Cava de' Tirreni	84013	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine	Overlooking a piazza surrounded by picturesque arcades in the historic centre (a walk around this district is highly recommended), this restaurant run by the Rispoli family continues to uphold its fine-dining traditions. Although a few meat dishes feature on the menu, it is its fish options (mainly traditional, such as tuna with mussels and escabeche-style aubergine) and occasionally imaginative desserts, such as the cheesecake with toffee and raspberry, that are the main attraction here.

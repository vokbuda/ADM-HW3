Atelier	piazza Matteotti 36	Domodossola	28845	Italy	€€€	Country cooking, Contemporary	The long-established Atelier is not only one of the leading restaurants in Domodossola, it is also the first ever in the Val d’Ossola to be awarded a Michelin star, adding to the tourist appeal of the town. Here, owner-chef Giorgio Bartolucci, flanked by his enterprising sister Elisabetta, has succeeded in skilfully and enthusiastically breathing new life into this restaurant which was founded by his parents, while his wife Katia oversees the impeccable service front of house with professionalism and a friendly smile. The bespoke open-view kitchen (made by local craftsmen and almost as big as the dining room) is definitely intended to be a distinctive feature which the energetic chef hopes will create a real connection between guests and his team. Flavour, variety and presentation are the keystones of the cuisine at Atelier, where the dishes are exciting, inspirational and occasionally feature intriguing reinterpretations of traditional local recipes.

Lucia	via Lampedusa 12	Giulianova Lido	64021	Italy	€€	Seafood, Classic Cuisine	Having just celebrated their 50th anniversary (they opened in 1971), this restaurant and hotel of the same name remain a solid culinary reference on the Abruzzi coast. The menu here is dedicated solely to fish and, as a result and is often the case, the wine list focuses almost exclusively on white wines. The fish (almost all of which comes from the Adriatic) is carefully sourced, while in the kitchen the chefs prepare classic dishes (such as enormous local langoustines cooked – and served – in a pan with oil, wine, garlic and rosemary) and a few more modern recipes (crispy mullet served with the award-winning spicy Ventricina salami).

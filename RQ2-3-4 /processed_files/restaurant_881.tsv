La Bandiera	contrada Pastini 4	Civitella Casanova	65010	Italy	€€€	Cuisine from Abruzzo, Contemporary	Although it takes a while to reach this restaurant that first opened in 1977, it is definitely worth the journey! Here, an entire family (second and third generations) works together with passion and enthusiasm to provide their guests with real gourmet hospitality. The cuisine, carefully planned and prepared by the parents alongside son Marcello, is based on a real respect for local, seasonal ingredients, some of which are produced by the family themselves (vegetables from the kitchen garden appear in nearly all the dishes, as does a home-produced extra-virgin olive oil). When it comes to technique, dishes have a modern feel, which makes the restaurant a flagship for top-quality Abruzzo cuisine. The couple’s other son, Alessio, works front of house and oversees the wine list, which includes impressive wine-pairing options. The excellent selection also includes a few pages of wines available by the glass, including top-of-the-range labels.

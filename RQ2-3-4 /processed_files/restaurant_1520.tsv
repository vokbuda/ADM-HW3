VeRo - Venetian Roots	Riva Ca'di Dio 2181	Venice	30121	Italy	€€€€	Modern Cuisine, Creative	Situated within the elegant Hotel Ca' di Dio in the Arsenale district where the Venice Biennale is held, VeRo is an elegant, exclusive and trendy restaurant. Despite the ambience, however, it’s the cuisine that is the real attraction here, thanks to excellent local and Italian ingredients which are transformed into creative dishes with references to the Venetian lagoon. Influences from other Italian regions also feature, including the occasional nod to skilful chef Luigi Lionetti’s native Campania.

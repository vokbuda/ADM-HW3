Villa Pignano	località Pignano 6	Volterra	56048	Italy	€€€	Contemporary, Tuscan	A veritable Garden of Eden just 15km from Volterra, this 300ha estate is home to a restaurant with a strong zero-mile philosophy. This is backed up by its careful use of ingredients grown or produced on the estate itself, such as vegetables, olives and grains, as well as chicken, pork and honey – a sustainable approach that results in delicious, contemporary cuisine. The dishes here are fresh and full of flavour yet elaborate and modern in style (note the simpler menu at lunchtime). The interesting wine list explores Tuscany through its choice of top-quality organic labels as well as including wines produced from the estate’s own vines.

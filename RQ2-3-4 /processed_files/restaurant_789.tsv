La Preséf	via Lungo Adda 12	Mantello	23016	Italy	€€€€	Creative	Overlooking an internal garden, this welcoming Valtellina-style Stube restaurant decorated in sweet-scented cembra pinewood is the perfect setting in which to enjoy local specialities and vegetables grown in the restaurant’s own garden. Zero-mile ingredients (the restaurant takes its name from the word for “manger” in local dialect and also boasts its own dairy) and visual experimentation are the distinctive features of the regional cuisine served here, with fish from the lake, game, DOP Bitto cheese and even local truffles all appearing on the menu. There are two tasting menus: a creative 7-course menu and a more traditional 4-course option. Comfortable, welcoming guestrooms and a modern spa complete the picture.

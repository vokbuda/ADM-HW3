Andrea Aprea	corso Venezia 52	Milan	20122	Italy	€€€€	Italian Contemporary, Creative	On the top floor of the Fondazione Luigi Rovati (housed in a magnificent historic building that is home to the Foundation’s Art Museum), talented chef Andrea Aprea has achieved his life-long dream with his eponymous restaurant. The setting is visually impressive, with a superb panoramic window boasting views of Porta Venezia park and Milan’s urban skyline. The large central dining room is dominated by a sparkling circular chandelier made from Murano glass and gold leaf, while the walls clad in black “bucchero” ceramics (from which the Etruscans used to make vases) lean slightly, directing the gaze towards the open-view kitchen. Here, guests can admire the chef and his team at work as they prepare the different dishes for the three tasting menus: Contemporaneità, a 5-course menu which explores the relationship between memory and innovation; Partenope, a 6-course menu focusing on specialities from Campania; and Signature, an extraordinary 8-course experience which expresses the chef’s culinary philosophy. Lastly, the palazzo’s hidden green courtyard at 52, Corso Venezia is home to the Caffè Bistrot where Andrea redefines family-style cuisine via a selection of classic favourites.

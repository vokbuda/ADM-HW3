Marco Bottega Ristorante	via Trovano 3	Genazzano	30	Italy	€€€	Creative	Surrounded by hills planted with olive trees and agricultural crops, and situated on a beautiful road leading from the border of the Ciociaria region to the Arcinazzo plateau, this 19C farmhouse is home to Marco Bottega, one of the most interesting young chefs working in the Roman countryside. As well as offering comfortable guestrooms, Aminta Resort also produces its own fruit, vegetables and meat from its 50ha estate, all grown and reared without the use of pesticides. From farm to fork, the ingredients produced here are used to create cuisine with a focus on the traditions of Lazio yet also open to other influences, resulting in authentic dishes full of flavour. The interesting wine list offers a wide selection of champagnes – the chef has also created a room in a separate building where guests can enjoy an aperitif or a wine tasting.

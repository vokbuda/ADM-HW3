Antica Trattoria Cattivelli	via Chiesa di Isola Serafini 2	Monticelli d'Ongina	29010	Italy	€€	Country cooking	As its address indicates, this restaurant is situated on an island formed by a loop in the Po river. Since 1947, the Cattivelli family have been celebrating the best of the Lower Po valley’s cuisine here in a rural, river setting that is typical of the region. Regional dishes take pride of place on the menu, always served in generous portions and often made using locally sourced ingredients, including fresh home-made pastas and excellent ice-cream, as well as conserves made from home-grown produce. Although not particularly traditional, we enjoyed the mushroom macaroni made in-house using organic flour, as well as the veal served with caramelised shallots and potatoes.

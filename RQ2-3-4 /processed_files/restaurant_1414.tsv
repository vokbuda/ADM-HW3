Cortile Spirito Santo	via Salomone 21, Ortigia	Syracuse	96100	Italy	€€€	Creative, Modern Cuisine	Situated near the castle at the southernmost point of Ortigia, this restaurant is part of the Palazzo Salomone Luxury Suites and is one of the most elegant places to eat in Siracusa. Here, Giuseppe Torrisi prepares creative, technically expert and authentically Sicilian cuisine, which is typical of the island’s elaborate, Baroque soul. It is also a feast for the senses thanks to its exciting, intense and often unforgettable flavours. Our inspector recommends the daily fish specialities (usually snapper, sea bass or other species caught by local fishermen) served with a seasonal accompaniment such as asparagus or peas in spring, and a coulis of yellow Scicli tomatoes. On the wine list, we recommend trying one of the local labels from either Etna or the west coast of Sicily, such as De Bartoli’s Terzavia VS Brut.

I Rodella	strada esterna vicinale della Rocca 2	Deruta	6053	Italy	€€	Innovative, Umbrian	This complex, which also includes two junior suites and seven guestrooms, dates back to the early 17C and was commissioned by the Church as a stopping off point for travellers on their way to Rome. For many years now, the restaurant has been run by a Venetian family with twin brothers (both highly experienced) working in the kitchen and a third brother, a sommelier, at the helm in the dining room. The cuisine is inspired by local and Venetian traditions, with a modern approach to the combinations of flavours (including home-grown herbs) and to the presentation of its delicious, generous dishes. We recommend that you do as we did and follow Samuele’s advice when making your choice from the dishes prepared by Stefano and Andrea with great skill and passion.

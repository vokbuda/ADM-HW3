Da Vincenzo	viale Pasitea 172/178	Positano	84017	Italy	€€	Campanian, Traditional Cuisine	It's never easy to find the right balance between quality and quantity, especially in a town that is very much on the tourist trail. However, Da Vincenzo has succeeded in doing just this for years, ever since it was first opened by the family’s grandfather Vincenzo in 1958. Today, the founder’s grandson (who shares his grandfather’s name) is at the helm here, creating dishes which focus mainly on fish. Pleasant atmosphere, with a few small tables on the pavement of the street that runs through the centre of Positano. A choice of cocktails supplements the wine selection from lunchtime onwards.

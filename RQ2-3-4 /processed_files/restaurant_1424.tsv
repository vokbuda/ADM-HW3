Da Lorenzo	via Fra' Gerardo Sasso 8	Scala	84010	Italy	€€€	Seafood, Mediterranean Cuisine	Slightly off the beaten track in the lesser-known village of Scala opposite Ravello, this authentic family trattoria offers an informal change from the many Michelin-starred luxury restaurants dotted along the Amalfi Coast. Da Lorenzo has been serving simple yet excellent fish and seafood cuisine for decades, with a wonderful and highly recommended array of fresh fish on display. A popular panoramic terrace adds to its appeal.

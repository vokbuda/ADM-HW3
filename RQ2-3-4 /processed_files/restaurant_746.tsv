Il Capestrano	via Gian Francesco Pizzi 14	Milan	20141	Italy	€€	Cuisine from Abruzzo	This restaurant takes its name from the warrior statue dating back to the 6C BC which was discovered in Capestrano (Aquila province) in 1934. The statue, carved from a single block of local stone, is one of the most mysterious finds in history. No such mystery surrounds the dishes served in this restaurant, which focuses on cuisine from the Abruzzo, including top-quality hams and cheeses produced by small-scale producers, as well as mutton, lamb, beef, barbecued lamb kebabs and other culinary delights.

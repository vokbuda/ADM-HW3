Quintessenza	via Lionelli 62	Trani	76125	Italy	€€€	Apulian, Contemporary	Having moved to new premises near Castello Svevo and Santa Maria Assunta cathedral, this restaurant now boasts splendid views from its outdoor terrace and a comfortable, historic ambience in its other dining spaces (including a cellar) which are decorated in tasteful contemporary style. Quintessenza remains in the capable hands of the Di Gennaro family – four brothers (including head chef Stefano) who are equally passionate about Puglia and its excellent ingredients, especially fish and seafood, all of which are showcased in the superb, precisely prepared modern cuisine served here. There’s just one table in the splendid wine cellar (book well in advance), which offers a fine selection of wines including a few labels by the glass.

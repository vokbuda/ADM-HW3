Trattoria Cibrèo - Il Cibrèino	via dei Macci 122 r	Florence	50122	Italy	€	Country cooking, Traditional Cuisine	This trattoria is named after the famous cibreo, a typical stew from Florence that Catherine of Medici was said to enjoy so much that she even attempted, unsuccessfully, to export it to France. It is often crowded, but there is no point in trying to book a table as they don’t take reservations. Roast rack of beef (gran pezzo) is one of the specialities.

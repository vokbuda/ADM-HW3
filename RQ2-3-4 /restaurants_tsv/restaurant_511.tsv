La Pineta	piazzale Sant'Anna 6	Sant'Anna	12020	Italy	€	Piedmontese, Traditional Cuisine	You will need a certain amount of patience to tackle the winding road through woods and hills to get to La Pineta, but the food makes the journey well worthwhile. There is a restricted choice – just one tasting menu, although the number of courses can be reduced – with the famous house speciality, fritto misto alla piemontese, taking pride of place. Spacious, welcoming guestrooms are also available.

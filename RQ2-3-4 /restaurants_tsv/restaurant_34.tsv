Osteria del Teatro	via Maffei 2	Cortona	52044	Italy	€€	Tuscan, Traditional Cuisine	Enjoy traditional cuisine served in an elegant 16C dining room with a fireplace or in more informal trattoria-style rooms, all of which are decorated with the same theatrical theme. The recipes here focus on local traditions and seasonal ingredients, resulting in colourful, well-balanced and beautifully presented dishes that are full of flavour. There are just a few tables on the small terrace near the entrance overlooking the pedestrianised street, so if you want to sit outdoors make sure you book well in advance.

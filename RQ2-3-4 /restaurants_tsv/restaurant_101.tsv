Il Mirto	via Provinciale Lacco, 284	Forio	80075	Italy	€€€€	Vegetarian, Modern Cuisine	When you arrive at the luxury Botania hotel, you’ll be accompanied through 3ha grounds of lush Mediterranean vegetation to the restaurant. You couldn’t have a better introduction to the cuisine that awaits at Il Mirto, where you can choose between two long tasting menus or a shorter four-course option featuring dishes from these menus. One of the menus is vegetarian, the other vegan and almost all the vegetables are sourced from the property’s own kitchen garden or from other local growers from Ischia. A delightful experience in a beautiful natural setting, with excellent service provided by young, friendly staff.

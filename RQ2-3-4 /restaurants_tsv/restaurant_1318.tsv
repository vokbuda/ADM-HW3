aldìVino	via Antonio Gramsci 201	Corciano	06073	Italy	€€	Italian Contemporary, Creative	Shelves stacked with wine bottles line the walls at this smart bistro-style restaurant, which also boasts a quiet outdoor space for summer dining. The cuisine is contemporary and creative, and is showcased on three tasting menus from which dishes can also be ordered à la carte. We particularly enjoyed and can highly recommend the chef’s two signature dishes (“piatti firma dello chef”), squid “dripping” and spaghetti with smoked butter, oysters and raspberries. Courses here are divided into meat, fish and vegetable sections (Terra, Acqua and Vegetale).

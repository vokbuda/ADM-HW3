Le Macine	via Lino Carlo del Favero 11	Vittorio Veneto	31029	Italy	€€	Country cooking, Regional Cuisine	Housed in a recently renovated 18C mill on the banks of the Meschio river, this restaurant is run by brothers Giuseppe (front of house) and Adriano (in the kitchen), who serve top-quality cuisine with its roots in local traditions and the occasional imaginative twist with warmth and professionalism.

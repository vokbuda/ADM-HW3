La Cuccagna - Giro di Vite	corso Umberto I 168	Crispiano	74012	Italy	€€	Apulian	There are many reasons to visit this excellent family - run restaurant in the village centre, the most important of which is the food – fresh vegetables, delicious first courses (the fresh troccoli pasta with wild chicory, cherry tomatoes and broad beans is excellent) and carefully selected meat dishes (the father was once a butcher! ). Close attention is also paid to the wine, with more than 500 labels just waiting to be opened in the beautiful wine cellar.

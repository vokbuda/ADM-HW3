Franceschetta 58	strada Vignolese 58	Modena	41124	Italy	€€	Emilian, Regional Cuisine	This lively, welcoming restaurant serves simple and traditional regional cuisine, especially from Emilia Romagna, alongside more creative fare. The “Tradizione in evoluzione” menu features classic favourites such as gramigna pasta with cream and sausage, while the “I love Modena” menu showcases more imaginative recipes, including a sweet cacio e pepe dish as a dessert. The menu also includes tortellini made by the Il Tortellante association founded by Massimo Bottura, a rehabilitation centre where young people and adults on the autistic spectrum learn to make fresh pasta by hand. The wine list has just a few carefully chosen wines, with a whole page dedicated to Lambrusco.

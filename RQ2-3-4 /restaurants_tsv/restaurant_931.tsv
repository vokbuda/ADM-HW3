Taverna dell'Oca	via dei Mille 24	Turin	10123	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine, Piedmontese	Occupying what were once old stables and a coach house, this traditional restaurant is directly run by its owner, who is also at the helm in the kitchen. His recipes range from regional specialities to fish, complemented by a more extensive evening menu which also includes tasting options (one of which is entirely dedicated to goose dishes). Although there’s a more limited choice at lunchtime, the high quality of the cuisine is unchanged. A small outdoor space overlooks the quiet street, offering views of the beautiful garden nearby.

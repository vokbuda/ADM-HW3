Rifugio Col Alt	strada Col Alt	Corvara in Badia	39033	Italy	€€	Classic Cuisine, Alpine	During the day this restaurant can be reached in just a few minutes by cable car, providing you with breathtaking views of the Dolomites, while in the evening (when the service is more attentive – things are faster paced at lunchtime) you have to arrange transport via snowcat. The name “refuge” refers only to the location as the cuisine is definitely that of a restaurant: although the menu features hearty mountain fare, it also includes modern options and a few fish-based recipes, including oysters. Last but not least, there’s a good selection of wines.

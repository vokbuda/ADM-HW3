Baita Piè Tofana	Località Rumerlo	Cortina d'Ampezzo	32043	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Seasonal Cuisine	On the slopes of the Tofana and directly overlooking the ski slopes, a characteristic and romantic mountain lodge with a contemporary touch, whose design manages to combine tradition and modernity, is also a source of inspiration for the cuisine. Dishes with a contemporary taste–Rossini al mare (beef, foie gras, cuttlefish and Teriyaki sauce) is excellent–made with considerable use of charcoal grilling, in both summer and winter, and ample use of local raw materials. With friends, experience the convivial Larin table, with a central built-in fireplace around which the seats are arranged. The wine list is worthy of note with a large choice of Champagnes and Italian bubbly.

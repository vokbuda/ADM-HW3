The Cook	vico Falamonica 9 r	Genoa	16123	Italy	€€€€	Modern Cuisine	Housed in the beautiful 14C Branca Doria palazzo in Genova’s historic centre with its typical narrow alleyways, this restaurant boasts an extraordinary ceiling decorated with frescoes by Bernardo Strozzi in 1618. Chef Ivano Ricchebono’s cuisine is served on three tasting menus from which guests can choose courses à la carte style, even combining dishes from different menus. The cuisine is largely creative in style, with an equal balance of meat and fish options available.

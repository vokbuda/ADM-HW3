Secondo Tempo	via Vittorio Amedeo 55	Termini Imerese	90018	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary, Modern Cuisine	Situated on the first floor of a building (formerly home to an apartment owned by chef Salvatore Campagna’s family), this intimate restaurant dates back to the 1920s, as do the frescoes on the ceiling and the Art Nouveau-style flooring. In contrast, the cuisine is modern Italian with obvious Sicilian influences, including a focus on seasonal vegetables (there’s even a tasting menu that is completely vegan). All the extra-virgin olive oil used for cooking and as a condiment is home produced.

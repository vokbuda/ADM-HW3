Sintesi	viale dei Castani 17	Ariccia	00072	Italy	€€€	Contemporary, Seasonal Cuisine	A modern, welcoming restaurant whose motto “Tradition & Innovation” perfectly sums up its cuisine. On the à la carte and tasting menus alike you’ll find classic dishes including risotto with peas, lemon and raw scampi alongside more creative offerings such as grilled pannicolo (hanger steak) with Nemi strawberries and herbs, all presented in a modern and precise manner, and with the occasional nod to Asian techniques and northern European culinary methods (fermentation, marinades, dry aging of fish etc). The wine list changes with the seasons and the menu.

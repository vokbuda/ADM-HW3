Il Cantuccio	via Dante 32	Albavilla	22031	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine	This welcoming, beautifully kept restaurant in the heart of green Brianza has a romantic and elegantly rustic feel. Here, enjoy opulent and generous cuisine created by chef Mauro Elli who moves easily between classic Italian favourites, occasionally adding his own individual touch to the dishes. His imaginative reinterpretations demonstrate a fascination with the sea (despite the restaurant’s geographical location), while the menu also offers “daily game specials” throughout the year. The focus here is on serving dishes full of flavour, rather than following passing trends.

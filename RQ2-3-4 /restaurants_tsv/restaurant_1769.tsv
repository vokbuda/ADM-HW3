Tano Passami l'Olio	via Francesco Petrarca 4	Milan	20123	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Modern Cuisine	Tano Simonato, chef-patron of this stylish modern restaurant located in a fine residential district, offers his creative cuisine that reinterprets Italian flavors in a modern key: food for him is not just nourishment, but also fun. He will then come to your table to advise you and tell you about his dishes, suggesting the best wine pairing, also thanks to a well-stocked cellar. The inspector recommends: Tiramisù of cuttlefish and potatoes, as well as Almond Cannoli stuffed with mousse of ricotta with almonds, candied lemon and chocolate drops, with citrus fruit cream and almond jam.

Al Carroponte	via De Amicis 4	Bergamo	24127	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine, Contemporary	This restaurant is renowned in Bergamo for its good choice of varied cuisine, as well as its lively, buzzing atmosphere. The excellent, tasty cuisine is typically Italian and contemporary in style, and includes luxury ingredients such as lobster and caviar, while the “classic” à la carte is enhanced by a selection of cured hams, cheeses and finger food. But the Carroponte’s beating heart is owner Oscar Mazzoleni’s passion for the world of wine, with an incredible selection of over 2 000 labels that puts many more famous Michelin-starred restaurants in the shade.

Arca	viale Rinascimento 137	San Benedetto del Tronto	63074	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Cuisine from Abruzzo	In business for over 20 years, Arca is definitely one of the best restaurants in this area. Elegantly modern in style, with part of the kitchen open to the dining room, the restaurant owes its success to its enthusiastic and imaginative owner-chef Massimiliano, who, assisted by his sister, reinterprets meat and fish specialities from the Abruzzo. All the ingredients are certified organic – so much so that the restaurant describes its style as “organic Mediterranean cuisine”.

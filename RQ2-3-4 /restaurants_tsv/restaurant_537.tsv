Caino	via della Chiesa 4	Montemerano	58014	Italy	€€€€	Tuscan, Contemporary	Standing in the centre of a charming Tuscan village, Caino is the gravitational centre of the cuisine of the Maremma, where Valeria Piccini is its proudest ambassador. This skilful chef sources the best ingredients from the region and then extracts every ounce of flavour from them, transforming typical “peasant” recipes and traditions into an extraordinary gastronomic experience on two tasting menus: “Piatti Storici” and “Idee in Movimento”, the latter inspired by an imaginary voyage around the world. Front of house, Valeria is ably assisted by son Andrea, who oversees the well-stocked wine cellar. In summer, the bistro-style Il Giardino di Caino opens on the terrace, serving dishes inspired by old family traditions.

Edelweiss	Località Crodo	Viceno	28862	Italy	€	Country cooking, Seasonal Cuisine	A real bastion of local cuisine for over 60 years thanks to the hard work of an entire family. The menu features mountain-style cuisine, including game dishes, a small selection of local cheeses (we highly recommend the Bettelmatt) and home-made ice cream. Relaxed and informal ambience.

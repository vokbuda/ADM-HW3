Bluh Furore	via Dell'Amore 2	Furore	84010	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary, Mediterranean Cuisine	The former Furore Inn hotel has reopened with a new contemporary Mediterranean look and a new name (the Furore Grand Hotel ), along with a new gourmet restaurant, the Bluh Furore. Boasting a white colour scheme, minimalist decor and attractive sea views, the restaurant is headed by executive chef Vincenzo Russo under the banner of famous three-Michelin-starred Enrico Bartolini, who is behind some of its legendary signature dishes, such as the half-fried prawn. The menu focuses on modern dishes that feature recipes and ingredients from Campania. A vegetarian tasting menu completes the picture.

Lazaroun	via Del Platano 21	Santarcangelo di Romagna	47822	Italy	€€	Cuisine from Romagna, Traditional Cuisine	The prototype of a typical Romagna restaurant, run by an efficient and friendly family team. Excellent choice of high - quality first and second courses, including fresh pasta, hams and salamis, meat options and grilled dishes. An interesting feature of the restaurant is the presence of ancient tufa caves in the basement. Created around 400 AD and part of an intricate network of underground passages, they were later used by the Malatesta family as an escape route and are now open to the public.

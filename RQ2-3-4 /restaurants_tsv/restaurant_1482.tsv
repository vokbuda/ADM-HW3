Zunica 1880	piazza Filippi Pepe 14	Civitella del Tronto	64010	Italy	€€€	Cuisine from Abruzzo, Modern Cuisine	The pleasant outdoor space and some of the hotel rooms at Zunica overlook Civitella del Tronto’s central square on which this restaurant stands. For more than 100 years, Zunica 1880 has been a proud standard-bearer for typical Abruzzi cuisine, as well as dishes influenced by the nearby Marche region. Seasonal vegetables take pride of place on the menu, served with carefully selected meat (make sure you try the lamb and pigeon!), all prepared with a fine balance of traditional and contemporary styles.

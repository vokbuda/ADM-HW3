Vecio Macello	via Macello 8	Verona	37121	Italy	€€€	Seafood, Modern Cuisine	Although Vecio Macello has retained a few unusual features on the ceiling from its former life as a meat-processing plant (such as the old pipes used to provide steam for the plant’s pasteurisation and meat preparation processes), this restaurant now has a strong focus on fish. The menu offers a selection of raw dishes and classic seafood recipes alongside a few regionally influenced meat options.

Al Camin	località Alverà 99	Cortina d'Ampezzo	32043	Italy	€€	Country cooking, Modern Cuisine	On the road to Misurina lake, this friendly restaurant with a modern Alpine style offers dishes of the regional tradition with imaginative touches and modern technique. So a great deal of practicality, then, as in the beef tenderloin wrapped in speck dry-cured pork with cep mushrooms and Ampezzo-style potatoes. The chef and sommelier Fabio Pompanin manages a wine list with approximately 200 labels. In the warmer season, take advantage of the open-air service.

Atto di Vito Mollica	via del Corso 6	Florence	50122	Italy	€€€€	Italian Contemporary	Behind the cathedral in Florence, this gourmet restaurant is housed in the Corte degli Imperatori at Palazzo Portinari, once the residence of the Salviati family. Here, chef Vito Mollica delights guests with culinary creations that focus on the sea and unusual combinations that come as a pleasant surprise. The ingredients are of the highest quality, from the fragrant home-made bread to the highly distinctive first courses, plus there’s an excellent choice of olive oils (mainly Tuscan and Umbrian).

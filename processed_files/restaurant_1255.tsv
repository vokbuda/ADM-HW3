Lunasia	viale Manin 4a	Viareggio	55049	Italy	€€€€	Modern Cuisine, Country cooking	One of the most original and imaginative chefs in the Versilia region is at the helm in the luxury Plaza e de Russie hotel’s showcase restaurant, where the bright, modern dining room overlooks Viareggio’s famous seafront promenade. Three tasting menus are available here: the first dedicated to fish, the second vegetarian, and the third focusing on meat, with guests able to choose courses freely from each menu à la carte style. Whatever you choose the dishes here are of a rare elegance, with occasionally striking presentations. Chef Luca Landi’s cuisine pays tribute to the region, using excellent ingredients such as local fish and produce from Tuscany’s inland areas.

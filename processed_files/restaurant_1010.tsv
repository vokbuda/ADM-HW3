Ceresio 7	via Ceresio 7	Milan	20154	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine	This designer-style restaurant is housed on the fourth floor of the historic ENEL palazzo, remodelled and converted into the Dsquared2 building. It combines the use of brass, marble and wood to create a successful blend of attractive colours and vintage decor. The view of Milan (even better from the long outdoor terrace with its two swimming pools) completes the picture, while the cuisine reinterprets Italian classics with a contemporary twist.

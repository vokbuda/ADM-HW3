Abbruzzino Oltre	Piazza Salvo d'Acquisto 16	Lamezia Terme	88046	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary, Mediterranean Cuisine	This restaurant, the new home of young chef Luca Abbruzzino, occupies the first floor of a historic palazzo in the town centre which has recently been converted into a small hotel offering six exclusive guestrooms. Guests can enjoy an aperitif in the elegant small lounge before making their way to one of the two dining rooms with just five tables in total (all ellipsoid in shape), where the chef’s surprise tasting menu is served. Featuring several small courses, the menu showcases imaginative and skilfully prepared dishes that demonstrate the chef’s love for his native region. We particularly enjoyed the dry-aged angler fish with black sesame (already renowned as one of the chef’s classics), spring onion, sultanas and anchovy sauce; the spaghetti with mullet, orange, turmeric and “nduja” sauce; and the pigeon with peach, tomato and barley. Although wine-paring options are available, you can also ask the talented and enthusiastic maître-sommelier to recommend a bottle or even simply a glass.

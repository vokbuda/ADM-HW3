Bracali	via di Perolla 2	Ghirlanda	58020	Italy	€€€€	Italian Contemporary, Creative	The small, fairly ordinary village of Ghirlanda in the heart of the Colline Metallifere is home to an unexpectedly elegant restaurant, where chef Francesco creates highly original and personalised cuisine. His focus is mainly on meat dishes, which are full of contrasting yet harmoniously balanced flavours (vegetable-meat, fatty-acidic, sweet-sour, soft-crunchy etc). Francesco’s brother Luca takes care of the wine and front of house with skill and dedication; the wine list is extensive and well structured, subdivided into two separate sections (Italy and the rest of the world). Bracali has established a partnership with the local diocese, including helping with the social integration of refugees and managing food waste. In the dining room, works of art are exhibited on a rotation basis and listed in a catalogue.

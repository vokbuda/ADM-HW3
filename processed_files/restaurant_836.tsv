Rifugio Fuciade	località Fuciada - Soraga di Fassa	San Pellegrino	38035	Italy	€€	Regional Cuisine, Alpine	To give you an idea of the Alpine location of this restaurant framed by the Costabella mountain chain, suffice it to say that for centuries it was used for mountain pasture.

The wine cellar is home to more than 600 labels, plus accommodation is available in a choice of tranquil guestrooms.

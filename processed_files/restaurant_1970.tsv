Nazionale	via Cavour 60	Vernante	12019	Italy	€€€	Country cooking, Modern Cuisine	Situated in the hotel of the same name in a typical mountain-style property, this elegant restaurant offers two welcoming dining rooms with open fireplaces and a profusion of wood, where friendly service adds to the warm atmosphere. Although meat dishes tend to dominate on the menu, a greater focus on vegetables has developed over the years, largely thanks to the three kitchen gardens (two of which are owned by the restaurant) which supply these vegetables. Choose between two tasting menus (one traditional, the other more contemporary in style) and a good à la carte selection. We particularly enjoyed the “bottoni” with tumin del Mel (a fresh cheese that is a symbol of the Varaita valley), lamb gravy and cavolo nero. There’s also now a new bistro in the old bar which serves lighter yet equally interesting dishes.

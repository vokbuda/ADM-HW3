Ape Vino e Cucina	Piazza Risorgimento 3	Alba	12051	Italy	€€	Piedmontese, Contemporary	This attractive restaurant in the heart of Alba, the gastronomic capital of the Langhe, is home to chef Damiano Nigro who has previous experience in Michelin-starred restaurants in the area. The restaurant serves aperitif snacks, tapas and top-quality cocktails alongside its delicious, generously portioned meals which, as you might expect in Piedmont, have a traditional flavour. The pasta, bread, desserts and ice-cream are all homemade, while on our last visit in the summer we particularly enjoyed the maccheroncini with scampi and peppers, and the exquisite Fassona beef with a red-wine sauce and seasonal vegetables. Booked ahead is recommended.

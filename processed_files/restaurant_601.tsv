Relais Blu	via Roncato 60	Massa Lubrense	80061	Italy	€€€	Mediterranean Cuisine	Situated across the water from Capri, this restaurant boasts one of the most beautiful views of the island from its dining room and outdoor terrace, with its unmistakeable and legendary silhouette visible in the distance. Fumiko Sakai is at the helm in the kitchen, but don’t be fooled by the name – although he was born in Japan, this chef has worked in this region for many years and creates authentically Campanian cuisine, often using vegetables from the restaurant’s kitchen garden. Fish obviously takes pride of place on the menu, but meat also makes an appearance, especially regional breeds such as Nero Casertano suckling pig and Laticauda lamb.

Sustanza	Galleria Principe di Napoli 13	Naples	80135	Italy	€€€	Creative	The entrance to this restaurant in the Galleria Principe di Napoli is through the 19C  ScottoJonno café chantant, from where you take a lift to the restaurant’s Liberty-style dining rooms with their elegant, historic feel. In contrast, the cuisine is modern in flavour, featuring complex and elaborate dishes that have their roots in the traditions and ingredients of the entire Mediterranean (including North Africa), as well as fermented products and the occasional grilled option. The end result is a surprising experience for anyone looking for a change from the usual traditional fare.

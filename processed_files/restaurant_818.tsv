Butterfly	SS 12 del Brennero 192	Marlia	55012	Italy	€€€€	Italian, Modern Cuisine	The 19C country house that is home to this charming restaurant is surrounded by its own garden, which can be enjoyed throughout the year thanks to its new glass veranda-style dining room – the veranda opens out into the fresh air in summer and is closed and heated in winter, yet still offers lovely views. The successful partnership of father and son (Fabrizio and Andrea Girasoli) in the kitchen results in an extensive menu featuring meat and fish dishes alike. The culinary techniques in evidence are equally at ease in classic-style dishes (superb langoustine from the Tyrrhenian sea freshly cooked on a lava stone and served with a frothy cocktail sauce, vegetable flowers and fruit) and more creative fare (such as the cocoa cigar stuffed with foie gras, apple and hazelnut – a dish dedicated to Puccini). The restaurant is run in a way that manages to be friendly yet at the same time incredibly professional, while the front of house and service is expertly overseen by the chef’s wife Mariella.

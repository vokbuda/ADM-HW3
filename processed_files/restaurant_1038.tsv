Maso Runch-Hof	via Runch 11	Pedraces	39036	Italy	€€	Regional Cuisine, South Tyrolean	Surrounded by woods, a trip to this restaurant housed in an 18C farmhouse is like taking a journey back in time. Take a seat in one of the wood-adorned Stube-style rooms and enjoy generous portions of delicious home-cooked Ladin specialities featured on a single tasting menu, including cajinci t’ega (spinach-filled ravioli), excellent pork ribs with polenta, and apple strudel. The small wine list has the same local focus, featuring labels from the Alto Adige region. A recent addition, the restaurant also now has a few spacious, welcoming chalets available for guests.

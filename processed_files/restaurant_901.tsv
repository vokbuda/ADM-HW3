Re Santi e Leoni	via Anfiteatro Laterizio 92	Nola	80035	Italy	€€€	Contemporary	Situated in a period building not far from the Duomo, this restaurant has a long dining room which resembles an aisle leading to the open-view kitchen to the rear. The dining room itself is contemporary and minimalist in style and serves as a backdrop for some of the most impressive cuisine in the area courtesy of Luigi Salomone, the talented chef at the helm who is renowned for his Campanian cuisine. Imaginative yet unfussy dishes, top-quality ingredients, and skilfully prepared bread and desserts (all superb, especially the reinterpretation of the typical “pastiera”) add to the appeal. Not to be missed!

Octavin	scalinata Camillo Berneri 2	Arezzo	52100	Italy	€€€€	Creative	Housed in two small dining rooms connected by an arch on the ground floor of an old palazzo, this restaurant is decorated with materials that give it a minimalist feel – a combination of stone, wood and iron in the tables, glass in the mirrors and bottles on display, and paper in the books arranged in small niches, just like the lounge of a private home. There are just 20 seats in this warm, intimate and unfussy restaurant, as well as a large counter separated by an arch at the entrance which precedes the recently restructured kitchen. Observation of his own region has shown owner-chef Luca Fracassi that the varied geography of his province is an inexhaustible source of inspiration. As a result, he has embarked upon an impassioned search for ingredients that best showcase the region, combining these in dishes that not only respect the flavours of his produce but also revive traditional local techniques and include the occasional oriental influence. His cuisine is modern yet eschews modern trends, paying careful attention to integrity of flavour and zero waste. In this way, the kitchen becomes a place in which wild ingredients and forgotten flavours are rediscovered and brought back to life. This focus on lost traditions combines ingredients such as snails and game (often neglected in urban restaurants) with a skilful and updated use of contemporary culinary techniques.

Antica Osteria il Ronchettino	via Lelio Basso 9	Milan	20142	Italy	€€	Milanese, Lombardian	The name seems to originate from the broken horseshoe (ronchetto) of Napoleon, who in 1800 appears to have stayed the night here, where there was indeed a post house where horses were shoed. Later converted into a bakery, butcher’s shop, but also a trattoria with an annexed bowling alley, today it is a restaurant of rustic elegance; the regional cuisine expresses itself in specialties such as fried brains and the ever-present Milanese-style cutlet that here becomes even “imperial”, definitely to be shared.

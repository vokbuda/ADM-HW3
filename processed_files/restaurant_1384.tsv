Qafiz	località Calabretto	Santa Cristina d'Aspromonte	89056	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Calabrian	Although getting to this restaurant is not easy, the pleasant drive that takes you through Calabria’s beautiful countryside dotted with countless olive trees makes it even more worthwhile. At the end of your journey, you arrive at an elegant late-18C villa with its adjoining old olive-oil mill that houses this restaurant crowned by a typical cross-vaulted ceiling. In 2023, a revolutionary refurbishment moved the kitchen into the centre of the dining room where guests sit around the counter-style Chef’s Table or at the single table set slightly to one side, enjoying just one tasting menu which is served to all guests at the same time. The focus here is on Calabrian ingredients (pigeon and oysters are sourced from outside the region), with produce such as the excellent extra-virgin olive oil, aromatic herbs and vegetables produced on the property, all transformed into creative and original dishes in front of guests by the skilful chefs. After your meal, you may like to move to the beautiful Aspro Cocktail Bar for a coffee, a small pastry or a cocktail. If you wish to prolong your stay, accommodation is now available in Casa Qafiz.

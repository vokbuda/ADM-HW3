Palazzo Utini	via Antonio Gramsci 6	Noceto	43015	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Contemporary	This historic building in the town centre has been brought back to life by the family of local entrepreneurs who bought it years ago and who have given the restaurant their name. Now an exclusive food venue just a stone’s throw from the capital of the “Food Valley” region, Palazzo Utini is home to a bar and bistro on its ground floor, while the first floor is occupied by the gourmet restaurant overseen by chef Enrico Bartolini and run by resident chef Roberto Monopoli who has plenty of culinary experience behind him. Guests can choose individual dishes from the tasting menus à la carte style, plus there’s an extensive wine list. We particularly enjoyed the exquisite turbot saltimbocca and the onion, black cherry and Lambrusco dessert. On the upper floors, elegant and intimate guestrooms are decorated in the same reassuring style as the rest of the building.

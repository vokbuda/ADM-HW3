LoRo	via Bruse 2	Trescore Balneario	24069	Italy	€€€	Creative	The cuisine served at LoRo is imaginative both in its presentation and its ingredients, which are combined in light, original and healthy (in the best sense of the word) dishes. The focus here is on fish and seafood, especially in the antipasti and primi courses, while all the dishes are listed with imaginative names on the menu. Chef Pierantonio Rocchetti reinterprets classic Italian favourites with flair and imagination, serving generous portions that do not skimp on flavour and taking guests on a delicious culinary journey that culminates in his excellent desserts. The restaurant’s “Sala Lab” is home to a large designer-style table that can be transformed to accommodate different numbers of guests, allowing the chef to prepare his dishes directly at the table in an ambience which is friendly and convivial while still maintaining an elegant feel.

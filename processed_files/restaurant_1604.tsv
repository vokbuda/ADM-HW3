Cracco Portofino	Molo Umberto I 9	Portofino	16034	Italy	€€€€	Seafood, Contemporary	Famous chef Carlo Cracco has opened a restaurant in what was once Il Pitosforo, right opposite the small harbour in Portofino, so that his lucky guests enjoy fine views of the water, the small square and the enchanting bay. Here, skilful and competent executive chef Mattia Pecis serves lightly modern cuisine with occasional references to Ligurian recipes (such as cappon magro salad) and ingredients (many of the vegetables are sourced from Iva’s kitchen garden on the hills nearby), with a new cooling cabinet in which fish are “aged”. The delightful terrace, open in summer from 6.30pm onwards, is the perfect setting for alfresco aperitifs and dinners.

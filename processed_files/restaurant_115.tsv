Votavota	lungomare Andrea Doria 48	Marina di Ragusa	97010	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Seafood	The perfect choice for those who love the sea, courtesy of the splendid views of the Mediterranean through the picture windows in the dining room. Guests can observe the two chefs at work in the open-view kitchen, where they prepare top-quality and surprisingly creative dishes, with an obvious focus on fish and seafood. We particularly recommend the smoked spaghetti with butter and anchovies – a creamy dish full of intense flavours, which is seemingly simple yet demonstrates real culinary expertise and makes the journey here well worthwhile! The wine list includes an excellent selection of Sicilian labels, from Etna to the offshore islands – the sommelier will be happy to help with recommendations. Why not start your meal with the superb 700 di Cusumano, a top-quality Chardonnay and Pinot Nero blend?

President	piazza Schettini 12/13	Pompei	80045	Italy	€€€	Mediterranean Cuisine	The menu at this restaurant features traditional dishes from Campania with updated twists, some of which (such as the “sigilinium” bread) even date back to Ancient Roman times. The cuisine, which is always delicious and beautifully presented, is showcased on various tasting menus from which individual dishes can also be chosen à la carte style and swapped from one menu to another. Although we chose to order fish (we particularly enjoyed the “Mediterraneo da scoprire” grouper dish), there is also a vegetable-based option. The front of house is overseen by the chef’s friendly and efficient wife, who is happy to offer wine recommendations and willing to open bottles of finer wines even if you only want one glass.

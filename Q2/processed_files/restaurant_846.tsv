Cocchi	via Gramsci 16/a	Parma	43126	Italy	€€	Emilian	This restaurant adjoining the Daniel hotel is the town’s pride and joy. Here, two quiet, rustic-style dining rooms provide the backdrop for typical Parma specialities that change with the passing seasons – the “tortelli alle erbette” (tortelli pasta with herbs) with parmesan and melted butter is particularly delicious – all accompanied by an excellent choice of wines. Booking in advance is highly recommended as the restaurant is extremely popular with visitors and locals alike.

Caruso Roof Garden	via Partenope 45	Naples	80121	Italy	€€€€	Campanian, Italian Contemporary	In a city that has its fair share of roof-garden eateries, this restaurant stands out as one of the most popular with fine panoramic views that take in the Castel dell'Ovo, Capri, the Sorrentine peninsula and Vesuvius... and, of course, the sea! Here, chef Emanuele Petrosino showcases the best of his cuisine on his tasting menus, which include “Suite 531” (dedicated to the legendary tenor Enrico Caruso), “Nel Blu”, “Per Mano” and “A Modo Mio”. If you’re choosing from the à la carte, we highly recommend the potato gnocchi with sea urchin, flavoured with Amalfi lemons and capers. Whatever you choose here, Campania’s fine produce takes centre stage, along with professional, attentive service and the beautiful Bay of Naples.

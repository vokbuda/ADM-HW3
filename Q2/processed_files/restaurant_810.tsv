La Tortuga	via XXIV Maggio 5	Gargnano	25084	Italy	€€€€	Classic Cuisine, Italian Contemporary	Although the name of this restaurant may conjure up images of the Caribbean Sea and its beaches, La Tortuga is actually located on the square overlooking the harbour right in the centre of Gargnano – its owners, however, are full of the spirit of the eponymous Caribbean island! This small, charming gem of a restaurant is run by female staff in its kitchen and front of house. The cuisine here takes no notice of passing trends, instead focusing on simple and precise cooking methods, so that the flavour of the ingredients (especially the seafood and fish from the lake) really shines through. The wine list is extensive, carefully put together and skilfully explained, with a focus on international wines. La Tortuga has been the proud holder of a Michelin star for over 40 years!

Piazza Duomo	vicolo dell'Arco 1, angolo piazza Risorgimento 4	Alba	12051	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Seasonal Cuisine	A distinctive red door marks the entrance to this temple of Italian cuisine. Once inside, make your way to the first floor, where you’re greeted by pink walls and a fresco by Francesco Clemente, as well as the restaurant’s friendly front-of-house staff. Here, the individual cuisine of chef Enrico Crippa takes centre stage on three tasting menus, with a fourth shorter menu available at lunchtime. One of the menus is inspired by the vegetable gardens and the seasons, another by the region, while the third takes guests on a culinary journey through Italy and further afield. What is obvious in every single, delicious bite is the chef’s passion for plants, with vegetables, flowers, wild and cultivated herbs harvested daily all featuring in memorable, beautifully presented dishes. The iconic appetisers featuring countless delicious ingredients are a feast for the eyes and the tastebuds alike and were particularly enjoyed by our inspectors. It hardly needs mentioning that this region is passionate about wine, so it’s not entirely surprising that the restaurant offers three different wine lists: Solopiemonte pays superb homage to the region, while Tuttoilresto (divided into two options, white and red) is a celebration of French wines. The efficient and enthusiastic serving staff succeed in taking good care of guests without being excessively formal, so that three hours (roughly the amount of time you need to allow for your meal) pass almost without noticing. The chef adds the finishing touch by bidding a discreet and friendly farewell at the end of the meal.

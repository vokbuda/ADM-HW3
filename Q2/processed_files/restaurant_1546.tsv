La Porta Antica	via Quarto dei Mille 16	Brescia	25128	Italy	€€€	Seafood, Contemporary	Having gained experience elsewhere in Italy, especially in Liguria where he gained confidence preparing the best-quality fish and seafood, Augusto Valzelli has returned home to demonstrate his own modern approach to fish cuisine. Fish-lovers will delight in his “gran crudo di mare” (raw fish selection) which allows the quality of the fish – the restaurant’s main attraction – to shine through.

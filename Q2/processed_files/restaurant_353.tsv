La Sala dei Grappoli	Castello di Poggio alle Mura	Montalcino	53024	Italy	€€€€	Modern Cuisine	A beautiful drive through typical picture-postcard Tuscan scenery of vineyards, cypress and olive trees takes you to the imposing medieval Castello Banfi, which stands proudly in front of this restaurant. La Sala dei Grappoli takes its name from the vines depicted in frescoes on the walls of its dining room, although in fine weather you’ll want to take advantage of the outdoor terrace where the beautiful views combine with impeccable service and superb cuisine to offer an unforgettable experience. Originally from Puglia, chef Domenico Francone includes Puglian specialities on the menu, such as histaralliand exquisitepanzerotti. Despite this, the chef has completely embraced Tuscan cuisine (often from the Maremma) which he interprets with real creativity, adding a personal touch to some of the region’s classic dishes. The wine list includes Castello Banfi’s fine Brunello wines, with recommendations provided by the excellent sommelier.

Moma	via di San Basilio 42	Rome	187	Italy	€€€	Creative	Situated between Via Veneto and Piazza Barberini, Moma is a modern, multi-faceted restaurant that serves informal dishes at lunchtime and more creative traditional fare in the gourmet restaurant on the first floor, which also includes a small outdoor dining space that allows guests to make the most of Rome’s mild climate. The balance between textures and combinations and the attention paid to presentation and top-quality ingredients are the key features here, resulting in regionally inspired cuisine that also includes creative dishes such as risotto with camomile, smoked eel, honey and oregano. This focus on the region and its fine local producers is also evident on the wine list, which leans towards labels produced by small artisanal wineries. The young staff are attentive and keen to ensure that your evening is a resounding success.

L'Acciuga	via Settevalli 217	Perugia	6128	Italy	€€€	Contemporary, International	You would never guess that there was a gourmet restaurant tucked away in this commercial district on the outskirts of Perugia, but everything changes once you’re inside the bright, original dining room with its open-view kitchen. Here, dishes combine international influences from the chef’s time spent outside Italy with various local ingredients, as well as fish. As is fashionable nowadays, the menu here simply lists the ingredients that make up a dish, even omitting articles and prepositions! Dishes such as CALAMARO, PISELLI (squid and peas) are written in capital letters, with no further description. The impressive wine selection has a special focus on natural and biodynamic labels.

Campo del Drago	Località Castiglion del Bosco	Montalcino	53024	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary, Tuscan	A certain amount of patience is needed to get to this restaurant accessed via a dusty yet attractive dirt track that wends its way through typical Tuscan landscapes. On arrival, you’ll find an enchanting village of medieval origins with a tower and an old frescoed church, where the Rosewood Castiglion del Bosco offers excellent service, splendid guestrooms and one of the best restaurants in the region. Chef Matteo Temperini serves some of the most interesting and creative dishes in Tuscany, many of which are made using vegetables from the hotel’s own kitchen garden. Dishes are served in an elegant, contemporary-style dining room with a panoramic terrace, while the wine list features various house wines, including the Brunello di Montalcino Campo del Drago, which gives its name to the restaurant. It’s worth noting that the dishes on the three tasting menus can also be chosen individually à la carte style.

Remulass	via Nino Bixio 21	Milan	20129	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine	“Cooking with roots” is the mantra at Remulass, a phrase that has inspired the restaurant’s name (“wild radish” in the local Milanese dialect). This small, lively restaurant gets very busy in the evenings when booking is highly recommended. The attractively modern and colourful dishes here always feature plenty of root vegetables and aromatic herbs. We recommend the fermented vegetables with baked ricotta and a gin dressing.

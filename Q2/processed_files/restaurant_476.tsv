La Péniche	via Lungo Brugiano 3	Marina di Massa	54100	Italy	€€	Seafood, Mediterranean Cuisine	This little corner of France right on the Brugiano canal occupies a house-on-stilts and has a unique, warm and romantic ambience thanks to its combination of colonial style and Parisian decor. Specialities include raw fish and seafood, including oysters, although you’ll also find meat-based dishes on the menu. The tables on the deck – which brings to mind a barge on the Seine – are very popular in summer.

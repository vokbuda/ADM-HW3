Trattoria da Amerigo	via Marconi 16	Savigno	40060	Italy	€€	Emilian	Situated in the hills immediately outside Bologna, Amerigo pays tribute to the typical Italian trattoria, taking guests on a nostalgic journey back to a time that will be familiar to all Italians and not just the inhabitants of Emilia. Just a few metres from the town’s main square, the restaurant’s entrance is via its own shop selling wine, sauces and other delicacies. From here, you enter the dining room and from there two further rooms on the first floor – one which was home to the first television in the village, now decorated with period ornaments, and a second adorned with frescoes. The cuisine is typical of Emilia and the Apennines, featuring an excellent selection of cured hams and fresh regional pastas, as well as game and truffles from the surrounding hills in season. Tradition, top-quality ingredients and a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.

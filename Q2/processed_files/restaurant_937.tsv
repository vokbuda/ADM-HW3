MaMe Restaurant	via Michele Coppino 56	Viareggio	55049	Italy	€€	Seafood, Modern Cuisine	Situated in central Viareggio near the town’s shipyards, MaMe occupies a long, narrow space that is reminiscent of Oriental restaurants with its long bench running alongside one wall and small bistro-style tables. This informal yet beautifully kept dining room is the backdrop for cuisine with interesting technical details such as the home-made mayonnaise served with the highly recommended steamed fish dish, and the delicious sourdough loaf which is freshly baked and served warm.

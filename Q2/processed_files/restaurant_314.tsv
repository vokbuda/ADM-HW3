Viva il Bistrot	via Rocco Pirri 19	Noto	96017	Italy	€€	Sicilian, Modern Cuisine	Situated just a stone’s throw from the cathedral, this restaurant has tables set out on Noto’s attractive pedestrianised street in fine weather, although if these are all taken the contemporary-style dining rooms are just as appealing.

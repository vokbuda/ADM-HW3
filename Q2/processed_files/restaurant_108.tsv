Agriturismo Ferdy	Località Fienili, fraz. Scalvino	Lenna	24010	Italy	€€€	Regional Cuisine	Once you’ve left your car in the car park and crossed the Brembo river, you enter a fairytale setting of meadows and horses surrounded by the Orobic peaks. Here, the cuisine is a declaration of love for the mountains – although occasionally technical and complex, it is always rounded and full of flavour, with meat and dairy produce taking centre stage. Guestrooms and a shop selling typical local produce complete the picture at what is an extraordinary, high-end agriturismo.

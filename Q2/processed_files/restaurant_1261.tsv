Vecchia Marina	lungomare Trento 37	Roseto degli Abruzzi	64026	Italy	€€	Seafood, Classic Cuisine	Vecchia Marina is renowned in the region (and further afield) for its superb fish and seafood and excellent value for money (the tasting menu priced at under 40 euros is truly extraordinary). Situated just a stone’s throw from the beach, the restaurant has a simple, informal feel, where the full focus is on the flavour of the fresh fish served in traditional dishes such as linguine with langoustine, garlic, olive oil and rosemary, and raw fish featuring the catch of the day. As you can imagine, booking well in advance is highly recommended!

La Palta	Località Bilegno	Borgonovo Val Tidone	29011	Italy	€€€	Country cooking, Creative	Situated on the plain at the foot of the hills visible in the distance, this restaurant resembles a typical country house with an elegant dining room extending into a kind of covered veranda, the windows of which open on to the garden and the greenery of the Bassa Piacentina countryside. The ambience here is pleasant and relaxed, perfect for an elegant dining experience, yet not too formal. Although the menu features local ingredients and recipes, such as the excellent focaccia (bread is a house speciality) served withciccioli(pork scratchings), the cuisine is creative without being overly fussy, and aims to please rather than amaze the palate. Our inspector recommends the roast donkey meat with “saracca” (herring) and “gorgnalini” – the latter is wild chicory, which adds a bitter taste and dash of bright green to an exquisite dish.

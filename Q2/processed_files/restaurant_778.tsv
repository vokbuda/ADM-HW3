Amistà	via Cedrare 78	Corrubbio	37029	Italy	€€€€	Italian Contemporary	Occupying a corner of the stunning Hotel Byblos, this restaurant is similar in style to the rest of the hotel with its colourful and harmonious blend of the old and the new, all of which is inspired by a real love of art. Echoing the decor, the cuisine served here plays with a combination of the traditional and the modern. The chef adds his own creative touches and interpretations to traditional recipes on three tasting menus: “Fattorie e Poderi” (meat), “Laghi e Mari” (fish), and the vegetarian “Campi e Orti”. Dishes can also be chosen à la carte style. The interesting wine list features more than 1 500 labels, including some rare options.

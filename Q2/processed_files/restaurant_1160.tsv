Remo Villa Cariolato	strada di Bertesina 313	Vicenza	36100	Italy	€€	Italian, Classic Cuisine	Long recommended by the Michelin Guide, the historic Remo moved a few years ago from its old premises to this beautiful villa typical of the Veneto region, once the home of an Italian hero, one of Garibaldi’s famous “Thousand”. Large and small dining rooms, perfect for special events, act as the backdrop for good regional and Italian cuisine, with a menu divided between meat and fish options. The latter comes almost exclusively from Chioggia market.

Magiargè Osteria Contemporanea	via Dritta 2	Bordighera	18012	Italy	€€	Ligurian	The dining rooms in this lively, typical restaurant in the upper, historic part of Bordighera appear to be almost dug out of the rock. Here, a local chef with plenty of experience behind him creates predominantly Ligurian cuisine (and not just fish and seafood), accompanied by an excellent and extensive wine list, including labels from outside Italy and a good selection of champagnes. Attentive service completes the picture here.

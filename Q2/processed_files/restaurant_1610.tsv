Belvedere	località Farina	Porto Cervo	7021	Italy	€€€	Seafood, Mediterranean Cuisine	Over the years, this family restaurant has become one of the most popular along this coastline. An informal dining room provides the backdrop for the decidedly Mediterranean cuisine served here, where the focus is the fish display cabinet that changes daily and from which guests can make their choice. The friendly and professional approach of the two brothers that run the restaurant has contributed to its success, while the brand-new terrace-lounge, with its stunning view, is the perfect spot for an aperitif or after-dinner drink.

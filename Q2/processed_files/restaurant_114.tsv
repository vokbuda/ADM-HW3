Su Murruai	via Giuseppe Garibaldi 36	Riola Sardo	9070	Italy	€€€	Contemporary	Situated in a small village looking out towards the Sinis peninsula, this restaurant occupies an old mill and is named after the aroma of aged Vernaccia wine (“su murrua” in Sardinian). The cuisine is contemporary yet influenced by traditional recipes and offers some of the best quality in the region. Young chef Ivan Matarese takes traditional ingredients and recipes and reinterprets these to create more modern dishes. Fish from Oristano bay and meat from inland areas take centre stage on the menu, including mutton in a delicious “pintadera” (open ravioli with saffron and liquorice). The chef also adds the occasional influence from Campania, his native region.

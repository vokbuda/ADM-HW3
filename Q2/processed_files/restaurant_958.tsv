Santa Elisabetta	piazza Santa Elisabetta 3	Florence	50122	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Mediterranean Cuisine	Thought to date back to Byzantine times, the Torre della Pagliazza has had many uses over the centuries, including housing a women’s prison in the 12C. Today it is home to one of the most interesting gourmet restaurants in Florence, where chef Rocco De Santis creates imaginative Mediterranean cuisine which is precise and full of flavour, with influences from his native Campania and an emphasis on fish and seafood. At lunchtime, a tasting menu of just three courses (“Carte Blanche”) is also available. As there are just a few tables here, guests are advised to book well in advance.

Maso Palù	via Graziani 56	Brentonico	38060	Italy	€€	Regional Cuisine, Alpine	An annexe to the family farm with its organic apple orchards, this rustic, welcoming restaurant situated on the road leading up towards Monte Baldo has been in business since 1984. Despite its years of experience, the management team here does not rest on its laurels but continues to serve cuisine rooted in regional traditions with just a touch of imagination and modern influence in some dishes.

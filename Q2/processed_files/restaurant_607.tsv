Lanterna Verde	frazione San Barnaba 7	Villa di Chiavenna	23029	Italy	€€€	Country cooking, Modern Cuisine	Thanks to its fireplace, the welcoming, classic-style dining room at this restaurant is perfect for winter dining, while its garden terrace attracts guests in summer. Whatever time of year you visit, you’ll enjoy cuisine which balances traditional recipes with more contemporary options, with a focus on local ingredients, especially fish from the lake. The Tonola family at the helm have been renowned throughout the province (and further afield) for their gourmet cuisine and welcoming hospitality for over 40 years. Their appeal is even greater today, thanks to young chef Roberto who provides a skilful modern touch in the kitchen, while his experienced parents oversee the front of house and make helpful wine recommendations.

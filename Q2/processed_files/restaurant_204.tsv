Achilli al Parlamento	via dei Prefetti 15	Rome	186	Italy	€€€	Creative, Contemporary	Situated just a stone’s throw from the Parliament building, this elegant restaurant’s origins as a wine bar are visible in the many wine bottles that line the walls of the dining room. Various tasting menus feature creative dishes with the occasional influence from Campania in top-quality cuisine that is rooted in traditional flavours. There’s a huge choice of wines by the glass, while bottles can be chosen directly from the wine boutique. In the room nearest the entrance, you’ll find the bistro which serves simpler fare and is also open at lunchtime.

Coria	Via Prefettura 21	Catania	95121	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary, Sicilian	Having left its previous premises in Caltagirone, this old acquaintance of the Michelin guide has now opened in Catania, right in the city centre between period palazzi and avenues planted with oleander. In a simple yet elegant setting enhanced by works of art by Nunzio Fisichella (a painter devoted to depicting Etna and its many moods), the delicate cuisine continues to focus on Italy with occasional Sicilian influences in its ingredients, sauces, style of cooking and flavouring – nothing here is forced. Special mention should be made of the grilled quail, which is perfectly cooked in Sicilian style, as well as the “Minnuzza di Sant’Agata” – stuffed cuttlefish with potato foam and candied lemon for a hint of freshness. When it comes to wine choices, the talented sommelier can tell you all about the region of origin, whether the wine is from Sicily, Italy or elsewhere in Europe. To finish your meal, make sure you try a glass of Marsala stravecchio from Intorcia.

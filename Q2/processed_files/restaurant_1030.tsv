La Speranzina Restaurant & Relais	via Dante 16	Sirmione	25019	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Contemporary	A romantic, Mediterranean-style restaurant in the heart of Sirmione, La Speranzina has a classic, elegant decor in which light colours dominate, while in summer the terrace boasts spectacular views of the lake and castle (a few of the tables stand right over the water). The menu, created by a new chef who trained with Heinz Beck, includes various tasting options featuring elegant dishes with a balance of different, occasionally exotic ingredients that result in inviting, carefully prepared and mouthwatering flavours. We particularly enjoyed the spaghettone with wild broccoli, clams, lemon, Espelette chilli peppers, gobbetto shrimps and cavolo nero. A superbly stocked wine cellar, with an excellent choice of champagnes and renowned labels, and three stunning panoramic suites for an overnight stay complete the picture.

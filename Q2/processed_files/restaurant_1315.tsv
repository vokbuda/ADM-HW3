Osteria Grande	piazza Grande 26	Arezzo	52100	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary, Seasonal Cuisine	This restaurant overlooking the magnificent Piazza Grande and the Loggia Vasariana that takes up one whole side of the square was opened in the summer of 2022 by the enthusiastic Fatjon and Lorenzo (if you ask, they’ll happily share their knowledge of Arezzo’s history with you). The former is at the helm in the kitchen where he expresses his passion for cuisine in seasonal, contemporary-style dishes such as pigeon breast, leg and fillet (each cut is prepared in the appropriate way) served with sweet onion and cocoa nibs, while the latter oversees the wine selection and recommends suitable pairings to guests. For the chef’s pigeon speciality, he may, for example, suggest an original Maturato Tiberini 2018 (a white wine made from grapes that are left to ripen on the vine). Cocktail staff are also hand for guests keen to choose an aperitif or an after-dinner drink from the extensive cocktail list.

Terrazza Bartolini	via A. Boito 30	Milano Marittima	48015	Italy	€€€	Seafood, Modern Cuisine	Following its reopening in 2020, this seafront restaurant overlooking the beach and small harbour now offers its guests a choice between its indoor dining room or the panoramic terrace in fine weather (if you prefer the latter, it’s best to book ahead due to its popularity). The cuisine here focuses entirely on simple, unfussy fish dishes, with raw options and cooked dishes which make much use of the local Cervia salt. Daily, market-fresh specials are announced at your table.

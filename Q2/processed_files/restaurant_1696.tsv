El Molin	via Muratori 2	Cavalese	38033	Italy	€€€€	Alpine, Creative	The sound of the creaking old wooden floor welcomes you to this old 17C mill, where owner-chef Gilmozzi acts as your culinary Alpine guide with his single tasting menu (guests also have the option of a slightly shorter menu) which showcases his love and passion for the mountains. Smoked produce and an incredible use of native herbs, bark, lichens and resins feature alongside unique cheeses, intensely flavoured wild game and freshwater fish, while the chef’s creativity and careful research guides his choice of cooking methods.

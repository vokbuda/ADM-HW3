Sine by Di Pinto	viale Umbria 126	Milan	20135	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary	Sine serves contemporary cuisine influenced by the chef’s native Naples, as well as the local region of Lombardy. The dishes are occasionally playful in style, as demonstrated by the shrimp ravioli served in various ways, including with an intensely flavoured fish stew. The chef’s speciality is his fried pizzetta with palamita fish and courgettes, while his new dishes are showcased on the exciting and creative “Sine Confini” menu, on which he demonstrates his culinary skills to the full. Attentive, courteous service and a constantly evolving wine list which includes some lesser-known labels complete the picture.

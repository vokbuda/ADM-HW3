La Buca	corso Garibaldi 45	Cesenatico	47042	Italy	€€€	Seafood, Contemporary	Choose one of the tables on the outdoor summer terrace (right over the water!) at this restaurant in order to best appreciate its location overlooking the picturesque canal port and its period houses. The indoor dining room is also attractive, with its open-view kitchen and a modern and elegant feel, while the menu focuses almost exclusively on fish, most of which is sourced from local fishermen. Enjoy a wide selection of raw antipasti to start (some simple in their preparation, while others are more elaborate), then choose from an array of beautifully presented, modern dishes, perhaps accompanied by one of the many champagnes included on the wine list.

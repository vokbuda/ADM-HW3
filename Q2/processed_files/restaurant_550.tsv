Seta by Antonio Guida	via Andegari 9	Milan	20121	Italy	€€€€	International, Contemporary	Situated within the Mandarin Oriental hotel, a popular choice for international travellers, this restaurant serves cuisine that reflects the cosmopolitan flavours of Milan. Three tasting menus are available: the first showcases chef Antonio Guida’s classic specialities, the second has a seasonal focus, and the third chooses one particular ingredient as its theme. In spring, different species of oily fish take centre stage including anchovies, spatula fish and bonito served with whelks, kidneys and samphire, all of which are truly delicious! The extensive wine selection features a choice of wines by the glass as well as some excellent magnum options, including a few fine vintages.

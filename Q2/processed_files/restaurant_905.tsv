Hosteria Grappolo d'Oro	piazza della Cancelleria 80	Rome	186	Italy	€	Roman, Traditional Cuisine	Since the turn of the century, this long-established restaurant near Piazza Navona and Campo de' Fiori has been run by five local business partners, one of whom is the chef. Top-quality, classic and generous Roman cuisine (cacio e pepe pasta, roast lamb, salted cod etc) is to the fore here, served in an attractive, rustic-style dining room. The background music – a nostalgic 1970s mix of rock and blues – also deserves a mention.

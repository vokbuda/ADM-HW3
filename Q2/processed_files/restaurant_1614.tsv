KELINA Fine Dine	Strada Lech de Boà s.n.	Corvara in Badia	39033	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Creative	From Corvara, take the ultra-modern Boè cable-car to this restaurant (accessible also on skis or by foot) which is one of the dining options at the Piz Boè Alpine Lounge (for access, turn right as you exit the cable car). Open at lunchtime only, KELINA serves unexpectedly gourmet cuisine in a minimalist-style dining room which allows the stunning views of Sassongher, Santa Croce and La Varella to take centre-stage through the restaurant’s large floor-to-ceiling windows. There’s a restricted choice of dishes, all of which are creative and based on Alpine ingredients, with a new, highly experienced chef at the helm since early 2024. An excellent wine list completes the picture.

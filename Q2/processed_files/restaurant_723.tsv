La Lumira	corso Martiri 74	Castelfranco Emilia	41013	Italy	€€	Emilian, Modern Cuisine	Situated in a village famous for its “tortellino in brodo” dish, Lumira serves Emilian cuisine with a modern twist. Highlights on the menu include fresh home-made pasta such as traditional tortellini and modern tagliatelle verdi with a beef and pea ragù, as well as the highly recommended veal fillet in a traditional balsamic vinegar sauce, which is full of intense flavours. Contemporary decor and welcoming service add to the relaxing dining experience. Among the Sangiovesi wines from Romagna on the wine list, we recommend Lillybet, a well-structured red with superb floral notes.

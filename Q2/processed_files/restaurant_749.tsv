Pacifico	via Moscova 29	Milan	20123	Italy	€€€	Peruvian, Asian Influences	Although its dining rooms are fairly small, this restaurant, which acts as an ambassador for Peruvian cuisine with the occasional Asian influence, has an attractive, trendy ambience and a theatrical feel. Excellent choice of ceviche – raw fish or seafood dishes marinated in lemon and flavoured with spices such as chilli pepper and coriander – which are a typical speciality of Latin American countries along the Pacific coast.

Boccondivino	via Mendicità Istruita 14	Bra	12042	Italy	€	Piedmontese, Traditional Cuisine	This restaurant is accessed via the internal courtyard of a typical period building, where meals are served alfresco in summer. The menu features a delicious array of Piedmontese specialities, including Bra’s famous sausage, “40-yolk” tajarin pasta, Carmagnola rabbit and “bonet” (a soft, creamy dessert). The simple, informal dining rooms tend to fill up quickly, so booking ahead is recommended, even at lunchtime. This is where the Slow Food movement began!

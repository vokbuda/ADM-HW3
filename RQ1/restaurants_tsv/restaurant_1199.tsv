Lillotatini	piazza Umberto I 13-14	Panicale	06064	Italy	€€	Umbrian, Traditional Cuisine	Situated in the heart of a small medieval castle-hamlet, this traditional-style restaurant with an attractive terrace on the historic square provides the setting for local specialities such as freshwater fish and truffles in season. There’s also a wine boutique on the same piazza (reached as soon as you come into the historic centre), which sells typical local produce and a good selection of wine. The latter also features on the restaurant’s wine list, with the family on hand to offer recommendations.

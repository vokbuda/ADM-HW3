Tubladel	via Trebinger 22	Ortisei	39046	Italy	€€€	Regional Cuisine	Although this restaurant with wood-adorned dining rooms has the rustic and romantic ambience of an old Alpine hut (the name “tubladel” is the Ladin for hay barn), it is actually situated just a stone’s throw from the centre of Ortisei. The cuisine focuses on local ingredients such as meat and game, with dishes such as venison pappardelle and roast pork shank on the menu, and very few fish options. Good selection of wines by the glass.	['Car park', 'Terrace']	['Credit card / Debit card accepted', ' Mastercard credit card', ' Visa credit card']	+39 0471 796879	https://www.tubladel.com/

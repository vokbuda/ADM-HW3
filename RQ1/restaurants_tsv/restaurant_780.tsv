Taverna Kus	contrada Castello 14	San Zeno di Montagna	37010	Italy	€€€	Farm to table, Seasonal Cuisine	An attractive restaurant situated on the western slopes of Monte Baldo overlooking Lake Garda, with a number of rustic yet elegant and welcoming dining rooms, including a bright veranda with partial views of the lake (enjoy the full vista from the outdoor terrace). Various culinary options feature on the menu, including meat, fish and vegetarian dishes, all colourful, full of flavour and beautifully cooked and prepared using mainly local and seasonal ingredients.

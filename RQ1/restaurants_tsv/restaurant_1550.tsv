Antica Farmacia	via del Popolo 51	Palaia	56036	Italy	€€	Tuscan, Seasonal Cuisine	As its name suggests, this restaurant was used as a pharmacy until the late 1970s. In 2010, it was taken over by owner-chef Juri who now runs his own restaurant here, serving Tuscan-inspired cuisine made using local ingredients and recipes which he reinterprets with a light touch. Full of flavour, dishes include highlights such as baked marrow and Tuscan Chianti beef stew.

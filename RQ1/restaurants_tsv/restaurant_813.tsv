Degusteria del Gigante	via degli Anelli 19	San Benedetto del Tronto	63074	Italy	€€	Country cooking, Cuisine from the Marches	Situated in the charming historic centre of the upper part of the town, right behind the Torre dei Gualtieri, this restaurant occupies a 19C building with 15C foundations. Regional cuisine skilfully reinterpreted with a modern twist takes pride of place on the menu, where the focus is on flavour and seasonal ingredients rather than a vast selection of dishes. House specialities include options such as boned caramelised rabbit served with its own jus (inspired by the better-known traditional Marche dish), while daily visits to the market usually result in one or two fish-based recipes.

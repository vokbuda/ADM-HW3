Magnagallo	via Magnagallo Est 7	Campogalliano	41011	Italy	€	Emilian, Traditional Cuisine	This restaurant decorated in typical local style welcomes guests with a mouthwatering display of cakes. But before you move on to dessert, enjoy local specialities such as tortellini in a capon broth and Emilian-style “fritto misto”. The classic accompaniment to a traditional meal in Modena is an excellent Lambrusco – we enjoyed a fresh Reggiano full of intense flavours.

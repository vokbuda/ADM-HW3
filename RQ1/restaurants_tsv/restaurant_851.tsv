Bruxaboschi	via Francesco Mignone 8	San Desiderio	16133	Italy	€€	Ligurian, Traditional Cuisine	You’ll need to allow plenty of time to get to the inland village of San Desiderio, where Bruxaboschi has been run by the same family and delighting guests since 1862, but the journey is certainly worth it. Justifiably famous, the cuisine pays tribute to local traditions (almost exclusively based on meat), starting with an excellentcima alla Genovese(a type of meat loaf),picaggeandpansottipasta dishes, and fried rabbit. Don’t miss the mushrooms in season.

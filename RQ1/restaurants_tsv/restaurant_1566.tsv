Da Gorini	via Verdi 5	San Piero in Bagno	47021	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Cuisine from Romagna	This restaurant in San Piero in Bagno’s historic centre takes its name from its young chef Gianluca da Gorini, who prepares original and creative cuisine inspired by the traditions of this beautiful hilly region as well as his own more imaginative creations. Frequently used ingredients include mushrooms, game, freshwater fish and Mora Romagnolo suckling pig, often combined with other more exotic fare. There’s a particular emphasis on dishes cooked over the barbecue grill, which gives ingredients such as lamb, eel and pigeon a particularly pleasant texture and flavour.

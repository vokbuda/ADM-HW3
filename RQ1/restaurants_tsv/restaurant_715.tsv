Accursio	via Grimaldi 41	Modica	97015	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary, Creative	Situated near the Duomo di San Pietro and the central Corso Umberto, this small, delightful restaurant occupies a historic palazzo and boasts a simple yet elegant decor including attractive floor tiles. Accursio offers three tasting menus with dishes also available à la carte. The restaurant’s symbol (an olive tree inside a boat) gives a good indication of the culinary focus here, namely a creative journey through Sicily’s cuisine on a menu that features both meat and fish options.

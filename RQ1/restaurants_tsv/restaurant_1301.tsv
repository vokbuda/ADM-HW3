Oishi	via Mario Capuani 47	Teramo	64100	Italy	€€	Japanese, Fusion	East meets West in this attractive restaurant situated in the centre of Teramo. Tribute is paid to Japan in the intimate dining room, where photos of the country adorn the walls and Japanese influences are evident in the fusion cuisine which is prepared using a blend of ingredients from Italy and further afield (raw and marinated dishes, sashimi and nigiri, sushi rolls, tempura etc). The new section entitled “temporary food” has a more seasonal feel.

Da Marino al St Remy	via San Salvatore da Horta 7	Cagliari	09124	Italy	€€	Mediterranean Cuisine, Sardinian	Situated on the edge of the pedestrianised area near the Bastione di Saint Remy, this restaurant is named after its charismatic owner Marino, who helps guests with their choice of menu and is happy to tell them all about the history of the restaurant (the street in front of the restaurant, for example, has not always been there). At the helm in the kitchen, his wife Silvana prepares Mediterranean dishes with a Sardinian flavour – the fish and seafood options are particularly delicious.

Castello di Fighine	borgo di Fighine	San Casciano dei Bagni	53040	Italy	€€€	Contemporary	A dirt track leads to this magical setting – an 11C castle perched among the Tuscan hills which is now privately owned and has been restored and renovated over the past 15 years. Situated in the hamlet surrounding the castle, the restaurant boasts a beautiful terrace shaded by wisteria where meals are served in fine weather. In the kitchen, the successful partnership between new resident chef Francesco Nunziata and three-starred Michelin chef Heinz Beck is immediately obvious. Two apartments are available in Casa Parretti for anyone wishing to prolong their stay here.

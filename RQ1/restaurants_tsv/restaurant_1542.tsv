Oblige	Via Jacopo Barozzi 6	Vignola	41058	Italy	€€	Italian Contemporary, Modern Cuisine	This new address with a cocktail bar and bistro (Noblesse) in the centre of historic Vignola is also home to a gourmet restaurant (Oblige), where chef Angelo serves easily identifiable yet technically skilful dishes. We recommend the game dishes cooked over the barbecue grill, such as the delicious local guinea fowl served with mustard mashed potato and sautéed radicchio. The wine list features labels from Italy and further afield with something suitable for every dish, including a few bottles that will appeal to wine connoisseurs.

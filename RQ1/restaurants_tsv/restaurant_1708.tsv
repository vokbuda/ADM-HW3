Kanton Restaurant	via Antonio Gramsci 17	Capriate San Gervasio	24042	Italy	€€	Chinese, Modern Cuisine	Capriate is home to one of the best Chinese restaurants in the region and beyond. Although Cantonese specialities take centre stage here, the menu also features dishes from elsewhere in China, including a remarkable selection of cooked and stuffed dumplings. If you want an all-round Chinese experience, there’s also a good choice of teas. The desserts tend to be more European in style.

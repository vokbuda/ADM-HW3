Acqua	lungomare Amerigo Vespucci 50	Vieste	71019	Italy	€€	Mediterranean Cuisine, Contemporary	Situated slightly above the marina, this elegant restaurant has a young chef at the helm who has cemented his reputation via contemporary, occasionally creative dishes which showcase the best local ingredients, including fish and seafood. The fact that the latter come directly from the family’s own fishmongers adds to the appeal.

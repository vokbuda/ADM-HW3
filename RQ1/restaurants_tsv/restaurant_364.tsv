Dina	via Santa Croce 1	Gussago	25064	Italy	€€€	Creative, Contemporary	Housed in what appears to be a simple village house on a street corner, this restaurant boasts four original and comfortable dining rooms, including the romantic rustic ambience of the former wine cellar, with its mix of modern, designer-style furnishings. Sitting at pleasantly large and elegant tables, guests have a choice of tasting menus from which individual dishes can also be ordered. Alberto Gipponi’s cuisine is a fine balance of tradition and creativity, served in one of the region’s most interesting restaurants.

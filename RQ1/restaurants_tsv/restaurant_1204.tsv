Antica Moka	Via Emilia Est 1496	Modena	41126	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine	Situated on the Via Emilia, this elegant, owner-run restaurant has for decades been renowned for its top-quality regional cuisine with an updated twist, as well as its reinterpreted fish specialities. Our inspector very much enjoyed the cuisine here, with a particular mention for the home-made pastas and excellent wine selection.

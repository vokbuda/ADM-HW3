Oltre.	via Majani 1/b	Bologna	40121	Italy	€€	Emilian	This restaurant in the lively Mercato delle Erbe district has an entrance adorned with hundreds of stickers, giving it the appearance of a record shop rather than a contemporary-style eatery with a bar counter and a highly original surfboard table near the entrance. The modern cuisine has its roots in the region yet also includes skilfully prepared dishes from around the world. There’s also a choice of cocktails to start or round off your meal. Booking is highly recommended.

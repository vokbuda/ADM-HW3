San Baylon	via di Ripetta 232	Rome	00186	Italy	€€€	Contemporary	Not far from Piazza del Popolo and Rome’s most exclusive shopping streets, this restaurant is situated in the Palazzo Ripetta hotel, in what was once the refectory of a 17C convent. Today, the ambience here is more informal, with an almost bistro-like feel, while the cuisine is inspired by classic Italian dishes, including various grilled options among the main courses. Meals are served in the palazzo’s inner courtyard in fine weather.

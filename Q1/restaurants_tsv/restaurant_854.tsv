La Meridiana	via Rosmini 11	Domodossola	28845	Italy	€€	Seafood, Classic Cuisine	In business for over 50 years, this long-established, centrally located restaurant has changed its look over the years and is now a modern bistro with an attractive outdoor summer space overlooking the magical town centre. Here, the owner-chef serves fish prepared in two different ways, either in typical Italian tradition or in a style inspired by his native Spain – his paella is definitely worth sampling! The front of house is overseen by the owner’s friendly wife, who is also at hand to help with your wine choices.

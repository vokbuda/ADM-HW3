Casa Coloni	via Tavernelle 86	Paestum	84047	Italy	€€€	Contemporary, Campanian	Situated opposite the archaeological site, this restaurant occupies an old farmhouse which is part of a splendid 19C residence converted into an elegant hotel following a long and meticulous restoration. In fine weather, tables are set out under a cane pergola in a charming setting in the romantic garden. Here, the chef from Paestum serves his own reinterpretations of regional dishes with superb results. Impeccable service.

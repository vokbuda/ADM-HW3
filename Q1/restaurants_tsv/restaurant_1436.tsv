Radici	Località Borgo La Chiaracia	Castel Giorgio	05013	Italy	€€€	Country cooking, Creative	Served in an elegant dining room or on the delightful outdoor terrace in fine weather, the highly creative cuisine at this restaurant has its roots in regional traditions and excellent local producers, while its stunning location within the luxurious Hotel Borgo La Chiaracia among the region’s verdant winding valleys makes it difficult to leave. With a choice of à la carte and tasting menus, our inspectors were particularly impressed by the Origini 20menu, on which all the ingredients are sourced within a 20km radius of the restaurant.

Oro Restaurant	isola della Giudecca 10	Venice	30133	Italy	€€€€	Italian Contemporary, Creative	For visitors not staying at the legendary Hotel Cipriani (home to Oro Restaurant), the excitement of this dining experience starts with your journey from St Mark’s Square. From here, the hotel’s private boat will take you to Giudecca island across one of the most spectacular corners of the lagoon which is overlooked by some of Venice’s most famous sights and monuments. Exploring and skilfully adapting nature’s incredible ingredients, the cuisine at Oro is certainly worthy of its magnificent setting.

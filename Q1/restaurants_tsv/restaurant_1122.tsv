Delicato	via Umberto I 2	Contigliano	02043	Italy	€€	Country cooking	Situated in a picturesque medieval hill-top village in the province of Rieti on the border with Umbria, this restaurant serves cuisine that is influenced by different regions and traditions. Choose between the minimalist-style dining rooms with exposed stone walls and, in fine weather, a charming outdoor space at the foot of Contigliano’s church. Here, chef Carlotta Delicato brings out the best of local ingredients in dishes that are kept deliberately simple and unfussy yet are full of flavour.

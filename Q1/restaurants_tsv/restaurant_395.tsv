Shalai	via Guglielmo Marconi 25	Linguaglossa	95015	Italy	€€€	Sicilian, Modern Cuisine	Situated in the historic centre of Linguaglossa, one of the most picturesque villages around Etna, this restaurant is part of the highly recommended hotel of the same name which occupies a delightful 19C palazzo. The Pennisi family are at the helm, alongside chef Giovanni Santoro, a partnership which has resulted in a long-standing Michelin star here on the slopes of Mt Etna. Santoro creates extraordinarily varied cuisine, which is not surprising given that Linguaglossa is situated in a mountainous region with rich volcanic soil that produces a whole host of unrivalled ingredients, with the added advantage of being just a few kilometres from the sea. Superb wine list, including magnums, vertical wines and top-quality labels from Etna.

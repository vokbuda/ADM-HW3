CiPASSO	via Metastasio 21	Rome	00186	Italy	€€	Roman, Mediterranean Cuisine	This contemporary bistro with a hint of vintage style in its decor now has a new location. The menu is inspired by Roman traditions, with the occasional imaginative twist and other more Mediterranean-inspired dishes, all showing a strong focus on seasonal ingredients. The excellent wine list includes a whole page dedicated to wines by the glass. Friendly yet professional service from the young team completes the picture.

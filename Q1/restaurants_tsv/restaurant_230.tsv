Angelo Sabatelli	via Santa Chiara 1	Putignano	70017	Italy	€€€	Country cooking, Asian Influences	A talented and brilliant chef is at the helm in this restaurant in the town’s historic centre, where elegant, contemporary-style dining rooms provide the backdrop for technical cuisine that showcases local produce with the occasional added Asian flavour. A visit to the large, well-stocked wine cellar is highly recommended (there’s an excellent selection of sparkling wines and champagnes), where a couple of beautiful tables are used for tasting and private dinners.

aede dining & wines	via Federico Cesi 22	Rome	00193	Italy	€€	European Contemporary	A small gem of a restaurant with a contemporary minimalist-style decor. The highly creative and technically modern cuisine has the same Nordic style as the dining room, influenced by the chef’s experience working in a number of Michelin-starred restaurants in Scandinavia. The menu changes every month and consists of twelve different dishes, with a minimum of four in the evening. Organic wines and a small outdoor dining space complete the picture.

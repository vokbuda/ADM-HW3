Attico sul Mare	piazza Kursaal 6	Grottammare	63066	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary, Regional Cuisine	Situated on the second and top floor (don’t worry, there’s a lift!) of the historic Kursaal building, this panoramic penthouse-style restaurant has recently been given a new contemporary design after nearly 20 years in business. The same modern feel is evident in the cuisine, which focuses (but not exclusively) on fish and seafood on its inviting menu. Classic local recipes such as seafood salad (with ingredients skilfully cooked in front of guests in the dining room) feature alongside the chef’s more creative options, such as turbot, in which nearly all parts of the fish are served – fillets, cheeks and even the “crackling”. For dessert, we recommend the alkermes cake with Italian pastry cream and chocolate, which is finished directly in front of guests in the dining room.

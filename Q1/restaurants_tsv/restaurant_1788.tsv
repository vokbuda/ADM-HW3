Casa Rapisarda	via IV Novembre 35	Numana	60026	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary, Seafood	This small welcoming restaurant on the famous Scalinata della Costarella in Numana, with a tiny terrace for summer dining and just a few tables, serves delicious cuisine with an imaginative twist. Originally from Sicily, the highly talented owner-chef has spent much of his life in the Marche and has plenty of experience in leading restaurants. Given the limited capacity here, booking is essential, especially in summer.

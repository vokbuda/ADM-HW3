Li Lioni	SS 131 km 244,400 - regione Li Lioni	Porto Torres	07046	Italy	€€	Sardinian, Home Cooking	The highlights of this restaurant just outside the tourist centre of Porto Torres are its informal atmosphere, spacious garden and traditional cuisine. The frattaubread is well worth sampling (also available in a vegan version), as is the legendary porceddu(suckling pig), which must be ordered when you book. When choosing wine, we recommend the well-structured and intense house red.

Castel Toblino	località Castel Toblino 1	Castel Toblino	38076	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine, Contemporary	Situated in a bucolic location in the Trentino where the excellent Vino Santo is produced (we recommend rounding off your meal with a glass of the equally superb grappa), this restaurant and adjacent bar occupy a fascinating medieval castle (tours of which can be arranged) jutting out into the lake of the same name. The generous, modern meat and fish dishes are featured on various tasting menus, along with an extensive à la carte. In summer, make sure you book a table on the charming terrace overlooking the lake.

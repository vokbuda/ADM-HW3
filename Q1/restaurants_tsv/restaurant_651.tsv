Vintage 1997	piazza Solferino 16/h	Turin	10121	Italy	€€€	Italian, Classic Cuisine	The several tasting menus at this restaurant include an on-trend vegetarian option, a Mediterranean menu (with an excellent tuna Chateaubriand and spring onion jelly), the typical Piedmontese “Punt e mes”, and the surprise Luna Park which gives free rein to the chef and is undoubtedly the most exciting option (must be booked in advance). Although not extensive, the wine list boasts interesting vertical options from the Langhe and further afield. The classic-style dining room is skilfully overseen by the owner.

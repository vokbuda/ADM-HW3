Luciano Cucina Italiana	piazza del Teatro di Pompeo 18	Rome	00186	Italy	€€	Creative	It is widely accepted that the best carbonara in Rome is served in this restaurant. We have to agree – and this is no mean feat, given that this is one of the capital’s iconic dishes. However, Luciano Monosilio’s culinary experience also extends to other equally delicious dishes, some inspired by the traditions of Lazio, others more creative in style, but all full of intense flavours.

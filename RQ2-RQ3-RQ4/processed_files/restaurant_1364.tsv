Osteria del Viandante	piazza XXIV Maggio 15	Rubiera	42048	Italy	€€€	Emilian, Modern Cuisine	Situated on the first floor of the 13C military fort in the centre of Rubiera, this elegant restaurant boasts five dining rooms, each one more delightful than the last and all frescoed, with the exception of the old limonaia which is decorated with wallpaper depicting its former function. This stylish and romantic setting provides the backdrop for young and enthusiastic chef Jacopo Malpeli who, having been born and raised between Parma and Reggio, creates cuisine that reflects the grandeur and opulence of local culinary traditions. Among his many interesting dishes, a particular favourite is the savarin di riso, which pays tribute to the legendary Mirella and Peppino Cantarelli and their former two-Michelin-starred restaurant in Samboseto. The extraordinary wine list includes several French wines alongside Italian labels and champagnes.

Villa Crespi	via Fava 18	Orta San Giulio	28016	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Mediterranean Cuisine	Just a stone’s throw from the enchanting village of Orta San Guilio with its picture-postcard views of the lake and San Giulio island, this three-Michelin-starred restaurant boasts a stunning location within a late-19C Moorish-style villa. Impressive both inside and out, this aristocratic residence was once the home of the Crespi family. Today, the villa’s leading light is Antonino Cannavacciuolo, who is now at the helm of a number of Michelin-starred restaurants, of which the Villa Crespi, the most famous and celebrated of them all, is the flagship. Although this chef originally from Vico Equense in Campania takes inspiration from all over Italy and further afield, it is the passion, colour and intense flavours of his native region that shine through in all his dishes. A truly extraordinary experience, with the lake and the villa’s beautiful garden as a backdrop.

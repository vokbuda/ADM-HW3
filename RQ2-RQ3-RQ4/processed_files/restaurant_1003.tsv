Inkiostro	via San Leonardo 124	Parma	43122	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Contemporary	Calabrian chef Salvatore Morello brings an innovative air to Parma, a city with a fine gastronomic reputation. Influenced by experience working abroad, he embraces diverse recipes and ingredients, all of which boast finesse, style and originality, and uses top-quality produce and ingredients which, even when they verge on the exotic, are always in harmony with the individual dishes. This chef’s memorable recipes include white skate, pickled Asian vegetables, beans and ramen, and his superb pre-desserts, including a 24-month-old parmesan dessert and delicious small pastries. The selection of beverages is on a par with the food, with beers, sake and spirits on the menu alongside an impressive choice of wine – for the latter, you can rely on the restaurant’s loyal sommelier to provide expert advice.

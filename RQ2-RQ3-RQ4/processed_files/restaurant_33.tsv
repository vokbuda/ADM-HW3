Arnolfo	viale della Rimembranza 24	Colle di Val d'Elsa	53034	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Country cooking	With sharp lines created by the use of iron and glass, this modern building is especially designed to allow guests to admire the views from wherever they’re sitting. To the rear of the dining room, the large open-view kitchen framed by a superb yellow Siena marble wall is home to chef Gaetano Trovato (Mentor Chef Award 2024) and his team. Although there are three tasting menus available, one of which is vegetarian, any of the courses can also be chosen à la carte style. We could say so much about Arnolfo’s cuisine, but we’ll limit ourselves to mentioning the bread (which has been central to this chef’s work from the very beginning), duck, Chianina beef, Valdarno chicken and the ice-cream which always features among the desserts. Our inspector particularly enjoyed the delightful amuse-bouche with which guests are welcomed, the caponata with Taggiasca olives and basil, and the mullet served with white asparagus, peas and mint. The wine list is impressive, both for its quality and for the extensive selection of wines not only from Italy and France but also from other countries around the world – 7,000 different labels in total.

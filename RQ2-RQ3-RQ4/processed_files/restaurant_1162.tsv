Glicine	via Mauro Comite 9	Amalfi	84011	Italy	€€€€	Mediterranean Cuisine, Italian Contemporary	Situated just outside Amalfi with the elegant Mediterranean landscapes of the Amalfi Coast as a backdrop, this fine-dining restaurant at the beautiful Santa Caterina hotel is perched above the sea and boasts stunning views and a tranquil ambience. Talented chef “Peppe” Stanzione from Salerno is at the helm here, having gained experience in renowned Michelin-starred restaurants in places as far afield as California, Australia, China and Thailand. While his passion for Asia is obvious in some dishes, it is the flavours and recipes of Campania that are to the fore, combined with other more exotic influences. Examples include the delicious tuna cooked in an infusion of sake and soy sauce and accompanied by smoked aubergine cream topped with crispy saffron onions and yuzu. There’s also a good choice of vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free dishes.

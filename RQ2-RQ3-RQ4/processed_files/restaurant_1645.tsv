Miramonti l'Altro	via Crosette 34, località Costorio	Concesio	25062	Italy	€€€€	Italian Contemporary, French	A French-Italian couple is at the helm in this attractive classic-style villa on the outskirts of Brescia, where a few tables have been laid out in the bay windows overlooking the garden. The friendly, experienced wife oversees the front of house, while her Breton husband is in the kitchen, where he recreates memories of his childhood in France through his use of French ingredients and culinary techniques. The menu also features more obviously Italian and Mediterranean dishes, all of which showcase the delicious, generous flavours that are the hallmark of the cuisine here. There is also an unforgettable cheese trolley with an excellent selection of cheeses in which Italy has the upper hand!

Filia Ristorante	via Francesco Anzani 19	Verona	37121	Italy	€€€	Creative, Italian Contemporary	An intimate and modern restaurant with just five tables and a minimalist design (with the exception of the “hip-hop” bathroom). Filia expresses the full character of its owner Michael Silhavì who has chosen Borgo Trento, a residential district not far from the city centre, in which to fulfil his dream of opening his own restaurant. He serves two tasting menus here (although he also sensibly also offers à la carte options), which are creative in style and occasionally play with traditional recipes such as the “Polpo alla Luciana” octopus dish. Simpler, faster options available at lunchtime. A colourful restaurant in every respect!

Savô	piazza XXV Aprile 8	Laigueglia	17053	Italy	€€€	Italian Contemporary	The reopening in 2022 of the Hotel Windsor with its romantic vintage decor, is a real bonus for Laigueglia, especially the hotel’s new gourmet restaurant Savô (which translates as “flavour” in Ligurian dialect). Here, a contemporary dining room and an outdoor space with views of the beach and the sea provide the setting for modern cuisine prepared from regional, seasonal ingredients with a focus on fish (there is also a meat option for each course). The impressive selection of wine and choice of cocktails from the elegant Windsor Bar adds to its appeal.

Locanda de Banchieri	via Porredo 32	Fosdinovo	54035	Italy	€€€	Country cooking, Farm to table	After spending time working in the Aosta Valley, chef Giacomo Devoto from Sarzana has returned to his native region, where he has converted an old 17C country farmhouse nestled amid tranquil verdant landscapes into an intimate inn with guestrooms and its own farm. Sitting on the panoramic veranda with its views of the sea and the coast, guests are served creative cuisine full of the delicious flavours of the Lunigiana. Devoto’s imaginative recipes are inspired by seasonal ingredients, with many of the vegetables (and the extra-virgin olive oil) grown on the farm itself, while the meat and fish are sourced either from inland or the nearby sea.

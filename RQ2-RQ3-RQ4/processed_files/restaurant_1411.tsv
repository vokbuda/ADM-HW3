La Pista	Centro Commerciale Lingotto - via Nizza 262	Turin	10126	Italy	€€€	Creative	This restaurant is situated on the top floor of Turin’s iconic Lingotto building, the former Fiat factory, where the famous test track for cars has been transformed into a botanic garden – an interesting place to visit before your meal. Once at your table, choose from Alessandro Scardina’s three tasting menus: “Radici, gli essenziali” (traditional Piedmontese cuisine); “Botanic World” (vegetarian dishes); and “Trust” (a surprise menu where you leave all the choices to the chef). Whatever you choose, you’ll enjoy remarkable dishes that are balanced and full of substance and intense flavours. To avoid getting lost in the Lingotto shopping centre, make sure you follow the instructions you receive and take the lift to the restaurant.

FØRMA contemporary restaurant	via Fortebraccio 53	L'Aquila	67100	Italy	€€	Creative, Contemporary	Situated in a secluded residential district that is part of L’Aquila’s historic centre, this intimate restaurant with an elegantly minimalist ambience is home to skilful owner-chef Simone Ciuffetelli. Having gained experience working abroad, Ciuffetelli showcases local ingredients in his creative, contemporary dishes, with the occasional use of fermented products and a frequent focus on just three ingredients. A good example is his dessert featuring cream and crunchy toasted hazelnuts generously coated with a white-chocolate mousse that is “disguised” as an Italian-style meringue thanks to a sprinkling of liquorice powder.

Tre Olivi	via Poseidonia 41	Paestum	84047	Italy	€€€€	Creative, Campanian	Oliver Glowig, German by birth but Italian by adoption, has returned to Campania where he’s now at the helm in the gourmet restaurant at the Savoy Beach Hotel. Here, his cuisine is showcased on two tasting menus (with dishes also available à la carte style) with many of his zero-mile ingredients sourced from the property’s own kitchen garden. He makes every effort to bring out the best of the Cilento’s abundant produce and typical Mediterranean recipes in his dishes which are contemporary in flavour and appearance. The restaurant’s only structural change is the new private room, which boasts its own kitchen, which can be used to host private events. The front of house also has new staff, whose skills ensure that guests are looked after with careful attention. When it comes to choosing wine, sommelier Roberto is on hand with his expert recommendations.

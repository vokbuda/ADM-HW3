Cuculia	via dei Serragli 3r	Florence	50124	Italy	€€€	Contemporary, Creative	This beautiful restaurant with a smart and elegant decor has the feel of a stylish French bistro with a small library-style dining room displaying books on cookery and other subjects. Chef Oliver Betancourt left his home country of Venezuela to train in well-known restaurants in France, Spain and Italy, experiences which have resulted in multi-faceted cuisine influenced by different traditions and prepared using seasonal Italian produce as well as more exotic ingredients such as kombu, soy sauce and koji. The menu offers a good selection of vegetarian dishes, as well as a few vegan options. The wine list includes extensive information on the different labels featured, including an excellent red from Bolgheri Acciderba.

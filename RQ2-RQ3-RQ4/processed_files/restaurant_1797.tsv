Il Falconiere	Località San Martino a Bocena 370	San Martino	52044	Italy	€€€€	Tuscan, Contemporary	To get to this exclusive restaurant, you drive through an idyllic landscape of small lanes lined with dry-stone walls and fields belonging to the Baracchi farm estate, of which Il Falconiere and the magnificent hotel of the same name are a part. Many of the ingredients served here, such as wine and olive oil, are produced on the estate and the restaurant’s strong connection with its local landscapes is evident.

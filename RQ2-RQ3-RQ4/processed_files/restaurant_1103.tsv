Marotta	via Marrochelle 52	Squille	81010	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine	Nestled amid the verdant hills of the Upper Caserta region, this delightful restaurant is a real gem. Young chef Domenico Marotta serves surprisingly high-quality cuisine with a focus on local ingredients and vegetables (some from the restaurant’s own kitchen garden) which he transforms into modern, minimalist yet generous dishes which are anything but predictable, and are showcased on three tasting menus and a short à la carte. We particularly enjoyed the Leccarda-style pigeon, a reinterpretation of a traditionally Umbrian dish, in which every part of the bird is used. The sommelier/head waiter is as impressive as the talented chef, as he guides guests on their culinary journey with his detailed and enthusiastic explanations.

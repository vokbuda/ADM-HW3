Chichibio	via Guglielmo Marconi 1	Roccaraso	67037	Italy	€€	Modern Cuisine, Cuisine from Abruzzo	Despite its lack of awards, this restaurant stands out for the quality of its cuisine. Situated in the town centre, it has a small intimate dining room with just a few tables (it’s best to book ahead) that acts as a backdrop for good-quality dishes made from local, seasonal ingredients, as well as a few modern and imaginative fish options. Highly recommended!

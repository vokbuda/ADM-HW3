Hostaria Baccofurore	via G.B. Lama 9	Furore	84010	Italy	€€	Regional Cuisine, Farm to table	Patience is needed to get to this restaurant from the coast, as a result of the winding road which makes its way through small villages, but once here the view of the sea is breathtaking. The village of Furore is built alongside the road and is famous for the Marisa Cuomo winery situated opposite the restaurant. The cuisine is as impressive as the vista, with its focus on different local ingredients cooked with a mix of traditional influence and imagination. Comfortable guestrooms are also available, almost all of which have been recently renovated and boast impressive views.

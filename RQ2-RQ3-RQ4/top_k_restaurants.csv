Ménage,Via Euplio Reina 13,"Situated in the heart of the city near the Teatro Bellini and Piazza Università, this restaurant occupies an Art Nouveau-style building. Here, a trio of experienced young chefs from Catania have brought new life to the old “Da Turi Finocchiaro” restaurant, which has always been very popular with the city’s high society. Offering a small outdoor space near the entrance, the quiet, intimate dining room on the ground floor provides the backdrop for reinterpreted, contemporary Sicilian cuisine with an exclusive focus on meat (especially barbecued dishes which are the restaurant’s trademark), while the first floor is home to a cocktail bar run with passion by one of the partners. Two frescoes painted by Giuseppe Barone in 1930 add to the appeal.",https://www.menagelounge.it/,0.43
Il Sanlorenzo,via dei Chiavari 4/5,"A historic palazzo built over the foundations of the Teatro Pompeo is home to this atmospheric restaurant, which brings together history and contemporary art. However, the real star is the fish on the menu, most of which comes from the island of Ponza, and is served either raw or cooked very simply in a modern style.",https://www.ilsanlorenzo.it,0.29
Vino Buono,via Castello 20,"Housed in an old 17C hay barn near the Duomo belltower, this interesting wine bar offers around 400 different labels to accompany an array of simple yet well-prepared traditional dishes (including a few fish options). Highlights include the cured hams, cheeses and the excellent starters.",https://vinobuono.net/,0.15
uovodiseppia Milano,via Amerigo Vespucci 11,"This completely renovated restaurant is situated in a pedestrianised area near Piazza Gae Aulenti, a new elegant restaurant district in Milan. Here, a wood-fired stove, attractive bar counter and small bistro-style tables provide the setting for carefully prepared Sicilian cuisine. Octopus, grouper and Mazara red prawns are just some of the top-quality Sicilian ingredients on the menu here, which includes reinterpreted recipes such as the “fuori Norma”, where the pasta is wrapped around the stuffed aubergine to create a dish full of Mediterranean flavours and aromas. The outdoor dining space in the pedestrianised street is perfect for early summer evenings, with its almost bohemian feel.",http://www.uovodiseppiamilano.it,0.15

El Brite di Larieto	Località Larieto, strada per Passo Tre Croci	Cortina d'Ampezzo	32043	Italy	€€€	Alpine, Traditional Cuisine	If SanBrite boasts a collection of Michelin stars (a classic star for its cuisine and a green star for its sustainable approach), it’s also thanks to this agriturismo’s location in a small larch wood, where it is surrounded by the spectacular Dolomites. Opened 20 years ago and renovated over the years, this smart agriturismo is also home to a stable annexe, where its restaurant celebrates the flavours of Alpine culinary traditions in its meat and charcuterie, cheeses, creamy butter and ice cream, as well as herbs, berries and other local ingredients.

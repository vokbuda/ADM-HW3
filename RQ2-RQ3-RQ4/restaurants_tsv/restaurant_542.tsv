Sud	via Santi Pietro e Paolo 8	Quarto	80010	Italy	€€€	Modern Cuisine, Seafood	Closed for refurbishment June-August 2024Quarto has made its mark on the gastronomic map of Italy thanks to Marianna Vitale’s cuisine and the tribute she pays to southern Italian produce, occasionally combined with more exotic ingredients. Once seated at your table, the only choice you have to make is the number of courses you want (rather than the dishes themselves) from two tasting menus of seven or twelve courses designed by the chef. The surprise menus (which take into account any food allergies or intolerances) have a slight focus on fish and seafood.

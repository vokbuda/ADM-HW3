Trattoria Pennestri	via Giovanni Da Empoli 5	Rome	00154	Italy	€	Cuisine from Lazio, Seasonal Cuisine	An authentic neighbourhood trattoria with just one difference – it is so good that its fame has travelled far beyond the streets of Ostiense in which it is situated and so it is often crowded (as a result, booking is highly recommended). The atmosphere is simple, informal and attractive, while the cuisine focuses on Roman classics such as pasta with carbonara, cacio e pepe, amatriciana and gricia sauces, alongside a few more creative dishes.

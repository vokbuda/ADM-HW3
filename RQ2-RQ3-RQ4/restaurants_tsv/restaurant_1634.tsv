San Tommaso 10	via San Tommaso 10	Turin	10122	Italy	€€€	Piedmontese, Modern Cuisine	In 1895 Luigi Lavazza opened here a grocery store where he immediately began blending coffee. 129 years later the place hosts a modern restaurant with a superb kitchen run by a chef who, despite hailing from the Marche region, treats guests to one of the most authentic interpretations of Piedmontese cuisine in the city, often with a creative touch. Among the options on offer here, the trolley of antipasti is a must.

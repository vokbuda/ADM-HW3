Hidalgo	via Roma 7	Postal	39014	Italy	€€	Grills	Although fish dishes also feature on the menu, Hidalgo has long enjoyed a reputation for its excellent meat options thanks to its different cuts of steak and beef sourced from all around the world and cooked mainly (but not exclusively) on the barbecue grill. In a separate room(Aomi, a kind of restaurant within the restaurant), guests can choose from a menu dedicated uniquely (from antipasti to main courses) to Japanese Wagyubeef.

Nole	viale Regina Margherita 84	Pescara	65123	Italy	€€	Italian Contemporary, Italian	Situated near the seafront in one of Pescara’s iconic streets, Nole offers guests two different dining options: the bar-bistro section serves excellent breakfasts, light lunches and snacks (closed in the evening), while the minimalist, contemporary-style dining room is home to the main restaurant. The two sections are separated by the open-view kitchen, where the chefs prepare classic, modern meat and fish dishes, with a focus on whatever ingredients are available in the market that day.

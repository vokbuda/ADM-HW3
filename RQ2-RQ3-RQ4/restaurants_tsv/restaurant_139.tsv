Amo	calle del Fontego dei Tedeschi, Ponte di Rialto	Venice	30124	Italy	€€€	Mediterranean Cuisine	Situated within the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, once a type of stock exchange where merchants from northern Europe traded with their Venetian counterparts and now a luxury shopping centre for those in search of high-end brands, Amo is the trendiest of the Alajmo group’s restaurants. Gourmet yet casual in style, the restaurant boasts an internal courtyard setting and lounge-style decor by Philippe Starck. The view of the Grand Canal and the rooftops of Venice from the top-floor terrace is stunning (booking is recommended although you may be lucky enough to get a table here when you arrive).

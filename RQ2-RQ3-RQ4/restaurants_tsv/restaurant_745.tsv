Voltalacarta	via Assarotti 60 r	Genoa	16122	Italy	€€	Seafood, Modern Cuisine	A tiny doorway leads to this simple, friendly and intimate restaurant with just a few tables, where booking in advance is highly recommended given the restaurant’s excellent reputation in the city. Its renown stems from the owner-chef’s cuisine, which focuses mainly on top-quality fish prepared in imaginative and personalised recipes using classic techniques. If it’s on the menu, make sure you try the “cappon magro” (a type of seafood salad), which is so good that it even has its own identity card!

La Locanda del Borgo	località Monte Pugliano 1	Telese	82037	Italy	€€€€	Country cooking, Creative	Chef Luciano Villani creates menus that focus on simplicity, organic produce from the Sannio region and an uncompromising philosophy. The restaurant is situated within the Hotel Acquapetra Resort&Spa, once an old farmhouse transformed into a luxurious hamlet, where antique furnishings and modern cutting-edge facilities combine to ensure a delightful stay in elegant surroundings. The gourmet restaurant adds to its appeal, featuring cuisine that is delicious and always recognisably regional, albeit with the occasional influence from elsewhere. There are two tasting menus:Aqua(fish dishes only) andPetra(dedicated to meat dishes). Aperitifs and drinks are served in the charming bar next to the restaurant.

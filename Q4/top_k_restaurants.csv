Ménage,Via Euplio Reina 13,"Situated in the heart of the city near the Teatro Bellini and Piazza Università, this restaurant occupies an Art Nouveau-style building. Here, a trio of experienced young chefs from Catania have brought new life to the old “Da Turi Finocchiaro” restaurant, which has always been very popular with the city’s high society. Offering a small outdoor space near the entrance, the quiet, intimate dining room on the ground floor provides the backdrop for reinterpreted, contemporary Sicilian cuisine with an exclusive focus on meat (especially barbecued dishes which are the restaurant’s trademark), while the first floor is home to a cocktail bar run with passion by one of the partners. Two frescoes painted by Giuseppe Barone in 1930 add to the appeal.",https://www.menagelounge.it/,0.35
Hyle,contrada Torre Garga SS 107,"Located on the wooded Sila plateau famous since Greek times, this restaurant aims to take guests on a culinary voyage through the region, from the hills overlooking the sea to the high mountain peaks. Although spanning just a short distance, this covers a fertile area which boasts a rich diversity of ingredients. Enhanced by the experience of chef Antonio Biafora, the restaurant’s focus is on top-quality local produce (vegetables, aromatic herbs, walnuts etc) sourced from local farmers and growers, creating a chain which is both economic and socially responsible. In addition to its à la carte options, guests also have the choice of two tasting menus, the regional character of which is emphasised by their Calabrian names (PùzalyandChjùbica). The first, a seven-course menu, takes its name from the Greek word “pisseres” which means resinous, while the second refers to the ancient road that linked Paola to Cirò Marina and consists of eleven courses, all full of flavour. Excellent value for money!",https://www.hyleristorante.it/,0.25
Il Sanlorenzo,via dei Chiavari 4/5,"A historic palazzo built over the foundations of the Teatro Pompeo is home to this atmospheric restaurant, which brings together history and contemporary art. However, the real star is the fish on the menu, most of which comes from the island of Ponza, and is served either raw or cooked very simply in a modern style.",https://www.ilsanlorenzo.it,0.24
San Giorgio,via Mancini 3,"Situated in the historic centre of Umbertide, beneath two arches in the main square where a monastery once stood, this restaurant serves personalised and modern cuisine in its three dining rooms and a small courtyard near the entrance. Presented on various tasting menus and an à la carte, the generously portioned dishes focus exclusively on meat (white and red) and offer excellent value for money. We particularly enjoyed the hearty and original “Pensando a un vitello tonnato” (literally “Thinking of a veal tonnato”). The friendly and knowledgeable sommelier is on hand to help with your wine choices.",https://www.ristorante-sangiorgio.it/,0.14
Tenne Lodges,strada Racines di Dentro 51,"Situated near the ski slopes in the Gourmethotel Tenne Lodges, this restaurant is decorated with a profusion of wood. The large dining room is the backdrop for delicious modern cuisine which is regional in focus yet also influenced by the chef’s professional experience around the world. Excellent wine list offering plenty of choice, plus a stone wine cellar which makes a charming setting for a pre-dinner drink.",https://www.tenne-suedtirol.com/it/gastronomia-culinario/ristorante,0.14

La Coldana	Cascina Coldana	via del Costino	Lodi	26900	€€€	Contemporary,SeasonalCuisine	Housed in an old 18C farmhouse on the outskirts of the town on the edge of the countryside, La Coldana is run by two young business partners (recently joined by the young chef Alessandro Proietti Refrigeri) who have gradually transformed it over the years into an eatery serving top-quality and distinctive cuisine, with some dishes now established as iconic favourites. Examples include the “turnips, roots and vegetables” dish made from over 30 varieties prepared in different ways and accompanied, as recommended by the chef, by mallow kombucha. There are three tasting menus available, one of which offers a selection of surprise dishes chosen by the chef.

Saporium	località Palazzetto 110	Chiusdino	53012	Italy	€€€€	Tuscan,ItalianContemporary	Saporium is the new fine-dining restaurant at the superb Relais Borgo Santo Pietro, an old property where the internal decor demonstrates a rare elegance, especially in the evening when hundreds of candles provide soft lighting and a romantic ambience in the dining room. In fine weather, meals are served under an elegant 13C portico overlooking the garden, with the property’s 100ha grounds and the Valle Serena as a backdrop. Much of the produce used in the cuisine designed by executive chef Hagen and transformed by resident chef Luca Ottogalli into modern, delicate dishes comes from the hotel’s own olive groves, vineyards, orchards and vegetable gardens. The focus here is on seasonal ingredients from this extraordinary region, such as the Borgo’s walnuts which are used in some of the delicious desserts. A whole host of wine-pairing options are possible thanks to the 1 000 different labels on the wine list.

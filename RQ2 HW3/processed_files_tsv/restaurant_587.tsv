Ca' Vittoria	via Roma 14	Tigliole	14016	Italy	€€€	Piedmontese,ModernCuisine	In the heart of this picture-postcard village, the Musso family has been welcoming guests with typical Piedmontese hospitality and professionalism for generations and delighting them with their interesting cuisine. Grandmother Gemma and mother Sandra always focused on regional traditions in their cooking; today, Massimiliano continues the theme while adding a touch of creativity and an international influence to his Piedmontese dishes. Examples include his innovative and original risotto cooked in onion water with eel and vanilla, and delicious Cherasco snails served with coconut cream, grilled home-grown leeks and fermented cabbage (the sweet flavour of the coconut provides a striking contrast to the acidity of the cabbage). There are just two tasting menus, from which dishes can also be chosen à la carte, plus a few classic favourites seasoned with white truffles (in season). The wine list features renowned Piedmontese labels alongside an array of younger wines, as well as a few bottles of Barolo from the 1970s.

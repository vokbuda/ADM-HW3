Famiglia Rana	via Feniletto 2	località Vallese	Oppeano	37050	€€€€	Contemporary,International	Situated within the natural oasis of Feniletto, this estate includes a garden with trees, a farmyard with chickens, stables for horses, an organic vegetable garden and an orchard. Recently given a new look, the restaurant now adheres even more closely to the Rana family’s philosophy of creating an ambience in which guests feel totally at home, where the lounge-style dining room features a profusion of warm wood, subtle lighting and soft background music. Also new to the scene is talented and experienced chef Francesco Sodano, who offers three tasting menus: “Ricomincio da tre”, inspired by the Massimo Troisi film and his native region; “Contaminazioni”, a 6-8-course menu which combines the chef’s Asian experiences with regional and Italian ingredients; and “Vegetale”, which also features 6-8 courses and is based around produce sourced from the vegetable garden and other small-scale growers. The latter menu gives centre stage to the region’s abundance of vegetables, made all the more unique by bold combinations and innovative cooking methods.

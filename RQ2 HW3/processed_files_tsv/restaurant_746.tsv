Bistrot	viale Franceschi 14	Forte dei Marmi	55042	Italy	€€€€	Seafood,ItalianContemporary	Despite its name, this is in fact a gourmet restaurant and not a simple bistro. It is run by the Vaiani, a family of professional restaurateurs and hoteliers who have entrusted the kitchen here to talented chef Andrea Mattei. This partnership has strengthened the style of Bistrot, which is somewhere between traditional and modern in feel and where the quality of the ingredients has always been of utmost importance. The restaurant is particularly renowned for its excellent fish, most of which comes from the Tyrrhenian sea, while it also boasts two wood-fired ovens in which the chef bakes different, truly delicious breads and cooks some of his dishes. The wine selection is a further attraction – the beautiful wine cellar is home to just under 2 000 different labels, with the choice of champagnes and Burgundy wines meriting special mention.

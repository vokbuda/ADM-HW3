Il Pagliaccio	via dei Banchi Vecchi 129/a	Rome	186	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Innovative	From its location in the heart of Rome, this restaurant takes guests on a culinary journey across the globe, with a focus on Asia and Japan in particular. Anthony Genovese blends influences from his experiences and travels to astonishing effect on two tasting menus – one dedicated to recipes that have become his signature dishes over the years, the other featuring new creations, all served in a quiet, elegant setting where excellent service is the order of the day. When the restaurant is open at lunchtime (on Saturdays), there’s also a shorter tasting menu, while if you want a longer and more private experience, you can book the Parallelsmenu served in a small room for a maximum of six guests.

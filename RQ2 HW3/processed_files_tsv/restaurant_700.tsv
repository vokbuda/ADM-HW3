Pierino Penati	via XXIV Maggio 36	Vigano	23897	Italy	€€€	ClassicCuisine	Surrounded by the greenery of the Brianza hills, this villa on the outskirts of the village boasts a delightful garden and an elegant dining room with a veranda. Although the cuisine here is traditional in style, it showcases the best of the Mediterranean in dishes that often feature modern preparation and combinations. Special attention is paid to the desserts, many of which are highly innovative, including one that pays homage to the Rubik’s cube. The impressive, well-structured wine list includes a selection of renowned labels from Italy and further afield alongside some younger, lesser-known options.

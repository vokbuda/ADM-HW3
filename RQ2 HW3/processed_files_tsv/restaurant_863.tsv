Ada	via del Bovaro 2	Perugia	6121	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	This new, contemporary-style restaurant is situated in the historic centre of Perugia just a stone’s throw from the town’s Etruscan walls (3C BC). Here, the experienced female chef serves meat and fish dishes full of the colours and flavours of this region and beyond, via two tasting menus and an array of à la carte options. We enjoyed the barbecued eel served in “tegamaccio” (a local freshwater fish soup), as well as our visit to its mysterious wine cellars – once a secret passageway, but now a treasure trove of superb and varied wines overseen by an enthusiastic sommelier.

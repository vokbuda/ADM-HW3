Artifex	Via Fleres 185	Brennero	39041	Italy	€€€	Contemporary,Creative	This restaurant is situated within the Feuerstein Nature Family Resort, a 5-star property which continues to expand and which nestles in the verdant Val di Fleres, not far from Vipiteno and even closer to the Austrian border. In the small, elegant dining room here, chef Tina Marcelli serves two tasting menus and a selection of desserts, all prepared with a passion that was inspired by the example set by her grandmother, who successfully raised and fed eight children. Dishes are often accompanied by drinks made from fermented fruit and herbs, most of which are sourced from the property’s own kitchen garden where they are grown without the use of any chemicals. Imagination, creativity and respect for seasonal ingredients are the main characteristics of the cuisine, which is prepared and served by an all-female team, ably supported by a young male sommelier. We particularly enjoyed the saddle of farmed venison with scorzonera and cherries, as well as the many sweet treats served after coffee.

daní maison	via Montetignuso 4	Ischia	80077	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary,Creative	This aptly named restaurant (At Nino’s house) is situated in chef Nino Di Costanzo’s own house in a residential district amid the hills of Ischia. Once over the threshold, you make your way through a garden planted with a variety of Mediterranean maquis shrubs and flowers, where aperitifs and post-dinner drinks are served in the evening. There are just a few tables in the dining room, which is crowned by a typical vaulted ceiling and where guests wishing to watch the chef at work can take a seat right in front of the kitchen. The dishes here are extremely elaborate, technical and sophisticated, perfect for anyone who loves concept-based cuisine with occasionally surprising results, including in presentation. If you’re coming here by car, take care on the last stretch of road which is particularly narrow.

Gallery Bistrot Contemporaneo	via Regina Margherita 3/b	Troia	71029	Italy	€€	ModernCuisine,Creative	Modern, tasty and carefully curated cuisine, which is prepared using the best seasonal ingredients. There is also a creative touch to some of the dishes, such as the vitello tonnato in which the meat (Fassona veal from the Piedmont) takes on the appearance of raspberries, or the delicate duck breast served with veal jus. The restaurant offers just 20 seats in a long dining room where the walls and ceiling form a sort of light wood-panelled arch that creates a real sense of movement.

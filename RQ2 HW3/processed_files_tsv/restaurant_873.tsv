Gabbiano 3.0	Porto turistico 11	Marina di Grosseto	58100	Italy	€€€	Creative	Overlooking the dock, this restaurant boasts a timber decor and 180° views of the sea and Punta Ala, the islands of Elba, Giglio and Montecristo, and the Argentario – a delightful panorama which is even more spectacular at sunset. At the helm in the kitchen, Alessandro Rossi creates two tasting menus featuring dishes that can also be ordered à la carte style. Not surprisingly, fish takes centre stage, although you’ll also find a few meat options and vegetables, many of which are sourced from the restaurant’s own kitchen garden.

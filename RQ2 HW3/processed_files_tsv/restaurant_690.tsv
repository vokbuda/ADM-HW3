Il Centro	via Umberto I 5	Priocca	12040	Italy	€€€	Piedmontese,ClassicCuisine	There’s a timeless feel to this restaurant, which is run by the Cordero family and serves some of the best Piedmontese cuisine in the region. Heading the team here are Elide in the kitchen and husband Enrico and talented son Giampiero front of house (the latter a real wine connoisseur who looks after the ever-expanding wine cellar), all of whom continue to maintain the high standards set by Giampiero’s grandparents when they opened this restaurant back in 1956. With skill and dedication, they serve traditional cuisine that is full of substance and flavour, which you could happily eat every day without ever getting bored, including the restaurant’s legendary peppers in a sweet and sour sauce, “agnolotti del plin” and finanziera stew, plus a few lighter fish and seafood dishes added in summer. Every year, after the restaurant re-opens in January and up to spring, the menu focuses on the legendary “fritto misto” made up of 12 courses of sweet and savoury dishes (booking a table for this is becoming more and more difficult!). Accommodation is available in the elegant Dimora Cordero just a stone’s throw from the restaurant.

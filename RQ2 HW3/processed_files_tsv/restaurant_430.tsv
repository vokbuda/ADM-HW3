La Capinera	via Nazionale 177	località Spisone	Taormina	98039	€€€	Sicilian,Creative	Sea & Air - Earth & Fire: the four elements come together on the tasting menus at this restaurant, where some dishes are named after movies (the Benjamin Button dish features fresh pasta “buttons” served with veal ragout and rosemary oil). Other highlights include the “cacao meravigliao”, a dish of delicious seafood tagliolini with red prawns and mozzarella foam, in which the delightfully fresh, raw Mazzara prawns have a wonderful texture. Elegant service, soft background music which creates a pleasant holiday atmosphere, and a vast selection of regional, Italian and European wines complete the picture.

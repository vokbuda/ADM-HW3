Zur Rose	via Josef Innerhofer 2	San Michele	39057	Italy	€€€	RegionalCuisine,ClassicCuisine	The long-established Zur Rose is a gourmet restaurant that has certainly made its mark along the romantic Tyrolean Wine Route. Here, chef Herbert Hintner serves his own version of creative contemporary cuisine which has a strong regional identity influenced by the Alto Adige, in an elegant building dating back to 1300 – the restaurant has been known as “La Rosa” since 1585. Ingredients and dishes change in line with the seasons, with two menus each season, one regional, the other vegetarian. Riding the crest of a wave for decades, Hintner’s cuisine never falters – especially now that his son has joined him in the kitchen. As a result, Zur Rose continues to offer an unmissable gourmet experience.

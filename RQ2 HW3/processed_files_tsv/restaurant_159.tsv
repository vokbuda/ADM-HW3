Maso Burba	via Bernardelli 32	località Piano	Commezzadura	38020	€€	Countrycooking,Alpine	Having spent time working in top-quality restaurants, Gianpaolo Burba – alongside his partner Paola who works front of house – has returned home to the family restaurant in a small village in the Val di Sole region. Here, he makes the most of his experience and skills acquired elsewhere to showcase the best of the region’s ingredients in his beautifully presented dishes (although fish does make a rare appearance on the menu). The dining rooms, including a covered veranda, are bright, elegant and typically regional in style.

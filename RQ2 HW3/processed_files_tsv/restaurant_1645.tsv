Belé	via Angelo Fumagalli 3	Milan	20143	Italy	€€	ItalianContemporary	The name says it all – in Milanese dialect, “belé” means beautiful and the word is an apt description of this restaurant. Belé is charmingly lit by an old-fashioned chandelier on which the pieces of crystal create a play of light resembling an intricate and shifting lace-like pattern. The dining rooms are decorated in attractive contemporary colours, with comfortable armchairs and acoustics perfect for conversation, while the cuisine is Italian with a modern twist.

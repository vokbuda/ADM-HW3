The modern, minimalist veranda-style dining room is welcoming and elegant, while the summer terrace has a romantic ambience with superb views of the coast, especially at sunset. The menu features modern, occasionally creative cuisine with Ligurian influences evident in dishes such as the “La mia Liguria” dessert which combines ingredients such as basil and olives with white chocolate, pine nuts and fiordilatte ice cream.

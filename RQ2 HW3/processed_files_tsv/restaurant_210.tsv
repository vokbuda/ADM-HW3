Il Tiglio	via Isola San Biagio 34	Montemonaco	63088	Italy	€€€	Contemporary,CuisinefromtheMarches	Clinging to the slopes at the foot of Monte Sibilla, Il Tiglio has returned to its original home after a few years based in Porto Recanati. The new modern, designer-style restaurant includes a few sections of the original building which was destroyed in the 2016 earthquake. Chef Enrico Mazzaroni describes himself as a “mountain chef”, but one with a weakness for fish specialities, so don’t be surprised to find rabbit in tempura, clams with potatoes or pasta, squid cream, pheasant ragù and tobiko on the menu. You can also choose between two tasting menus: “Ritorno”, where the dishes are chosen from the à la carte, and “Transumanza” which features more elaborate and experimental options using local specialities and ingredients such as chitterlings, fish and seafood.

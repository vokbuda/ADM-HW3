SanBrite	Località Alverà	Cortina d'Ampezzo	32043	Italy	€€€€	Alpine,ModernCuisine	This restaurant has just a few tables amid a decor of elegantly recycled old wood, while a large window offers views of the stunning Ampezzo Dolomites outside. Your meal starts in a memorable way: waiters file into the dining room carrying mountains of creamy butter, which is served to every table accompanied by excellent bread with an incomparable texture. Owner-chef Riccardo Gaspari makes careful use of home-produced and regional ingredients, creating delicious cuisine in which mountain traditions are refreshed with modern touches, most noticeably visible in the desserts which are made without adding extra sugar. Sanbrite literally means “healthy pasture”, a name that definitely evokes the qualities of the cuisine served here.

L'Olivo	via Capodimonte 14	Anacapri	80071	Italy	€€€€	ItalianContemporary,Creative	This two-Michelin-starred restaurant is situated far from the crowded alleyways of Capri, in the greener and more residential Anacapri, where its backdrop is the semi-hidden Capri Palace, one of the island’s most luxurious hotels. Here, a large, elegant drawing room is the setting for Italian cuisine with a particular focus on Campania, with dishes which are occasionally reinterpreted with a modern twist and always brightly coloured and full of flavour. A real pleasure for the palate, with primi that are truly exploding with flavour (such as the eliche pasta with rock fish and the risotto with a Neapolitan ragu), chef Andrea Migliaccio’s cuisine is accompanied by impeccable and professional service.

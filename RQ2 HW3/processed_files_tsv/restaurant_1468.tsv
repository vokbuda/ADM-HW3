Cacciatori	via Moreno 30	Cartosio	15015	Italy	€€	Piedmontese,SeasonalCuisine	You pass through beautiful hilly scenery to get to Cartosio, where you’ll find this typical country house (part of which has been recently renovated) specialising in local cuisine. Although it’s been in business for five generations, the formula has hardly changed, with a focus on Piedmontese dishes made as much as possible from locally sourced produce, cooked in the wood-fired stove and announced at your table.

I Due Cippi dal 1976	piazza Veneto 26/a	Saturnia	58014	Italy	€€€	MeatsandGrills	The first sight to greet you when you enter this restaurant is a barbecue grill for cooking meat; the meat itself can be seen ageing nearby, with numerous cuts and meats to choose from and the famous Chianina beef taking centre stage. The small yet elegant dining rooms, welcoming ambience and friendly service all add to the appeal, as does the excellent section of wines. Meals are served outdoors in summer.

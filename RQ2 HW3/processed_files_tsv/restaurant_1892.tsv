La Stüa de Michil	strada Col Alt 105	Corvara in Badia	39033	Italy	€€€€	Creative,International	To get to this restaurant you head up towards the church in the prettiest part of Corvara, where you’ll find the La Perla hotel, one of the best in the valley, on your left. Once inside the hotel, you’ll be accompanied to La Stüa (stube in Ladin), where the profusion of wood lends an intimate and romantic feel to the decor. Although the setting is typical of the region, Simone Cantafio’s cuisine will take you on an extraordinary culinary journey. Originally from Calabria, this chef worked for many years in Japan, just one of his many formative experiences. As a result, his dishes feature different influences, often with a focus on vegetables. The name of the restaurant is a reference to owner and manager Michele Costa, an indefatigable and extraordinary figure in the world of Ladin tourism.

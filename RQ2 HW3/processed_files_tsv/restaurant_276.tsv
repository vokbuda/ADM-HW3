Osteria Veglio	frazione Annunziata 9	La Morra	12064	Italy	€	Piedmontese	With its own convenient car park and a large terrace boasting views of the Langhe, this minimalist-style restaurant built in the 1920s serves excellent food. As fans of offal dishes, we were delighted to see lamb kidneys in a Marsala sauce on the menu – a dish which certainly did not disappoint! Guests are required to choose a minimum of two dishes from the à la carte, excluding dessert.

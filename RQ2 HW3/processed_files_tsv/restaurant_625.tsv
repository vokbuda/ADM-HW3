Da Noemi	via Ragno 31/a	Ferrara	44121	Italy	â‚¬	Emilian	The mother of the current owner opened this busy restaurant in a medieval alleyway in the historic centre, giving it her own name. The historic dishes here reflect the culinary traditions of Ferrara, with specialities such as salama da sugo (pork sausage) and pasticcio di maccheroni (a baked pasta dish) on the menu. A must for anyone looking to sample local dishes already famous during the time of the Este family.

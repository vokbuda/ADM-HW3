Frosio	piazza Lemine 1	Almè	24011	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine	Housed in a 18C villa which was once a family inn, this restaurant is run by the dynamic and professional Frosio family who have over 30 years’ experience in the restaurant business. There’s nothing improvised about Frosio, where Camillo guarantees impeccable service front of house and Paolo is at the helm in the kitchen, creating carefully prepared dishes with a classic-modern feel and an equal emphasis on meat and fish, often made from traditionally “gourmet” ingredients such as scampi, lobster, foie gras, pigeon and caviar. The wine list continues to offer an excellent selection, with one section dedicated to Italy and another to the rest of the world. Decorated with austere elegance, the wine cellar in the 13C tower is home to more than 1,000 different labels. Attractive outdoor space for summer dining.

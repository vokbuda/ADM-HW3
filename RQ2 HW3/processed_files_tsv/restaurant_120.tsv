St. George by Heinz Beck	viale San Pancrazio 46	Taormina	98039	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	One of the most desirable and exclusive locations in Taormina, the St. George is situated in the Hashbee Hotel, an early-20C villa on the edge of Taormina’s historic centre which has retained all the charm of a private house with its elegant lounge and breathtaking terrace adorned with palm trees that frame the Straits of Messina. The cuisine comes courtesy of a partnership between Heinz Beck and resident chef Salvatore Iuliano. The three-starred Michelin chef’s instinctive elegance and gastronomic intuition combine with Calabrian-born Salvatore’s passionate and colourful take on Mediterranean cuisine. Together, the cuisine and setting guarantee an unforgettable dining experience.

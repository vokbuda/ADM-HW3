Trattoria del Nuovo Macello	via Cesare Lombroso 20	Milan	20137	Italy	€€	Lombardian,ModernCuisine	Named after the slaughterhouse opened opposite the premises in 1927, this restaurant was taken over 30 years later by the grandfather of one of the current partners, as he was convinced that the restaurant’s busy location would contribute to its success – and he wasn’t wrong! The traditional, regional cuisine served here is reinterpreted with a contemporary flavour and includes delicious specialities such as cotoletta alla milanese made from meat matured for 40 days.

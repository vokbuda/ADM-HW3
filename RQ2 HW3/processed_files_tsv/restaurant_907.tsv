Casa Buono	corso Cuneo 28	Ventimiglia	18039	Italy	€€€	Countrycooking,Creative	This unexpected Ligurian gem is situated in Trucco, a small village in the Val Roia just inland from Ventimiglia. There’s no à la carte here, just the “Orto e Mare” tasting menu to which guests can also add a meat dish and a selection of cheeses from the well-stocked cheese trolley. Although the dishes are occasionally influenced by Ligurian traditions, they are for the most part creative, surprising and beautifully prepared. Given its success, the restaurant has recently been extended while at the same time retaining its simple, colourful and welcoming ambience. The high-quality service comes courtesy of the chef’s friendly wife, ably assisted by her professional and capable staff.

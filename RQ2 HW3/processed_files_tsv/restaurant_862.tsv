Specus	Via Casilina 315	Valmontone	38	Italy	€€	RegionalCuisine,MediterraneanCuisine	This charming restaurant’s name comes from the Latin and refers to the small grotto carved out of the tufa rock in the courtyard, which is home to just a few tables. The restaurant is run by a young couple, with Flavia front of house and Alessio at the helm in the kitchen. The cuisine is authentic in style, with imaginatively named dishes such as “Quel viaggio che non scordo” (“This journey I’ll never forget”) and “Dal 2014” (“From 2014”). The Riso Acquerello with fermented goat’s cheese, black truffle and herb pesto is truly memorable, while the desserts (especially the apple strudel) are equally delicious.

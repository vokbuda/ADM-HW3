Raieü	via Milite Ignoto 23	Cavi di Lavagna	16033	Italy	€€	Seafood,Ligurian	After more than 60 years in business, this trattoria housed in an old warehouse for storing fishing nets is still a solid choice for quality and price alike. Situated in the centre of Cavi di Lavagna, the restaurant is simple and old-fashioned in feel, while an outdoor space overlooks one of this small village’s narrow alleyways. The restaurant continues to specialise in typical Ligurian fish and seafood, which is simply prepared, copious and full of flavour. The soup is one of the house specialities, the pesto is excellent, and many of the unusual dishes feature local, seasonal ingredients such as Lavagna’s broccoli cabbage stuffed with fish.

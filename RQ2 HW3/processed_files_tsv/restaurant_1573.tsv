Leon d'Oro	via Gambara 6	Pralboino	25020	Italy	€€€€	Countrycooking,Creative	Situated in the historic centre of a small village between Brescia and Cremona in the Po Valley, this restaurant occupies a period palazzo with an interior full of history. From the exposed beams on the ceiling to the open fireplace, every detail here contributes to the traditional ambience in the dining room, which is enhanced by an outdoor space for alfresco dining in summer. The cuisine pays particular tribute to the region, with snails, delicious Brescia-style kid and game all featuring, although there’s also room for a few fish dishes and more creative options on the menu. The wine list clearly demonstrates how much care owner Franco Martini has taken to enhance his cellar over the years, including only those vintages that he knows will delight his guests.

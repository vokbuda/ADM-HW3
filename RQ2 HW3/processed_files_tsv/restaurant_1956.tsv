MOI Omakase	Viale Piave 10	Prato	59100	Italy	€€€€	Sushi	Situated in the centre of Prato, with views of the Castello dell’Imperatore, this restaurant takes guests on a culinary voyage to Japan without leaving Italy! All guests eat the same single menu, starting at 9pm, as part of which the chef prepares his selection of sushi and sashimi directly in front of them in the dining room. Omakase means “I trust you” – an act of trust that you certainly won’t regret. Our inspector recommends the miso and monkfish soup with kelp and green onions.

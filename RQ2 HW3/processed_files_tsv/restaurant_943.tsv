Antica Osteria Moirago	via Pavese 4	Moirago	20080	Italy	€€	ItalianContemporary,Seafood	This old monastery in Moirago, overlooking the Naviglio Pavese canal, was founded in 1250 and converted into an inn as early as 1478. Centuries may have passed, but the tradition of hospitality continues in the building’s enclosed painted portico, as well as in its two warm and atmospheric dining rooms. The chef’s Puglian origins explain the abundant use of vegetables and raw fish dishes, while in winter the cuisine takes on a more northern Italian flavour. Good selection of wines by the glass.

Taverna Estia	via Guido De Ruggiero 108	Brusciano	80031	Italy	€€€€	Contemporary,Creative	An aromatic herb garden greets visitors to this restaurant, followed by jasmine-covered alcoves that provide the perfect setting for a romantic dinner in fine weather or, if you prefer to eat indoors, an elegant dining room with a wine cellar and open-view kitchen. The restaurant is run by brothers Mario and Francesco Sposito (the former front of house, the latter in the kitchen), who together keep alive the soul of the restaurant that they inherited from their parents. They have also improved the quality so that the restaurant’s reputation now extends well beyond the region. Choose from different tasting menus (from which dishes can be chosen à la carte if you prefer) featuring remarkable and exciting dishes influenced by the flavours of Campania. More than a thousand wines, including an impressive choice of French labels, complete the picture.

Acquolina	via del Vantaggio 14	Rome	186	Italy	€€€€	Creative,MediterraneanCuisine	This modern, softly lit restaurant is situated in The First Roma hotel near Piazza del Popolo. With few decorations to distract the gaze and discreet, professional service, all the attention here is concentrated on Daniele Lippi’s cuisine. The chef creates two tasting menus – the first, shorter option focuses on fish dishes, while the second longer menu also includes a few meat options. Whichever you choose, you’ll enjoy creative cuisine which is also hearty, generous and full of substance, with a strong emphasis on aromatic herbs and a few barbecued dishes.

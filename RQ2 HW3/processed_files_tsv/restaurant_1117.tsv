Pascucci al Porticciolo	viale Traiano 85	angolo via Fiumara 2	Fiumicino	54	€€€	Seafood	A focus on the sea underpins the whole philosophy of this restaurant, which is perhaps not surprising at a coastal location such as Fiumicino! Here, chef Pascucci celebrates the sea to the full on his “Come è profondo il mare” menu which showcases beautifully presented dishes accompanied by a wine list that celebrates local producers from the Lazio coast. The chef selects top-quality local ingredients which he prepares with an almost Oriental precision – we particularly recommend the raw gurnard with ceviche, Kaluga-Amur caviar and courgettes. Vanessa oversees the dedicated front-of-house team, who provide warm and attentive service.

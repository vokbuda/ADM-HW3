Le Grenier	piazza Monte Zerbion 1	Saint-Vincent	11027	Italy	€€€	CuisinefromtheAostaValley,ModernCuisine	In the heart of Saint Vincent, this restaurant has a hint of an old granary (grenier in French) with tumbling grain, a fireplace and period tools on the walls. But the surprise doesn’t end there: the kitchen seduces its guests with unexpectedly modern dishes, some reminiscent of the Val d’Aosta tradition.

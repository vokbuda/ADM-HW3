Rifugio Fuciade	località Fuciada - Soraga di Fassa	San Pellegrino	38035	Italy	€€	RegionalCuisine,Alpine	To give you an idea of the Alpine location of this restaurant framed by the Costabella mountain chain, suffice it to say that for centuries it was used for mountain pasture. There’s a breathtaking view of the Dolomites which extend into the distance as far as Pale di San Martino, while the menu here focuses on regional recipes such as canderli dumplings on a bed of cabbage, veal stew with polenta and chanterelle mushrooms, and polenta gnocchetti with herb pesto, smoked ricotta and lemon thyme. The wine cellar is home to more than 600 labels, plus accommodation is available in a choice of tranquil guestrooms.

1908	via Paese 18	Soprabolzano	39054	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Contemporary	The name of this restaurant refers to the year in which the hotel in which it is located (the Park Hotel Holzner) was opened, while the design is a nod to the Liberty style of the period. Despite this, both the ambience and the cuisine bear the modern and imaginative hallmark of Stephan Zippl. Paying careful attention to sustainability, this chef selects the best regional produce for his dishes – even the Wagyu beef is raised in the chef’s native Renon region. This strong connection with the Alto Adige is also evident on the excellent wine list, which features almost 400 labels from the region and provides perfect pairings for the chef’s tasting menu. Other options include non-alcoholic drinks such as apple juice and alcohol-free cocktails.

L'Ostreria Fratelli Pavesi	Località Gariga 8	Podenzano	29027	Italy	€€	Countrycooking,ModernCuisine	Overlooking a 20C courtyard typical of the Bassa Padana area, this restaurant’s name (a play on the word “osteria”) refers to the three (“tre”) brothers who share the work in the kitchen and front of house. It’s clear that the saying “many hands make light work” holds true here: the many dishes served in this simple, friendly dining room include local specialities such as cured hams, salumi, anolini pasta, ricotta and spinach tortelli and “bomba di riso” (a moulded rice dish), as well as main courses of venison and sturgeon and a delicious “zuppa inglese” (trifle) for dessert. Booking ahead is recommended, even for a weekday lunch, as it gets very busy.

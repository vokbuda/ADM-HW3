Despite the ambience, however, it’s the cuisine that is the real attraction here, thanks to excellent local and Italian ingredients which are transformed into creative dishes with references to the Venetian lagoon. Influences from other Italian regions also feature, including the occasional nod to skilful chef Luigi Lionetti’s native Campania.

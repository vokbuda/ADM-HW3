Colline Ciociare	via Prenestina 27	Acuto	3010	Italy	€€€€	CuisinefromLazio,Creative	Guests who make it to this restaurant situated some 60km from Rome on a road with plenty of winding bends show real commitment, probably because they’ve heard of the culinary delicacies that Salvatore Tassa brings to the table here. There’s a restricted choice but unlimited imagination in dishes which range from traditional Italian classics and recipes from Lazio to bolder, more innovative, fare typical of the culinary world of this chef-cum-poet who eschews all definitions and fashions. At the modern Nù bistro, enjoy some of the chef’s more traditional and long-established recipes.

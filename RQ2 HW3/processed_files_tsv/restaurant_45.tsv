Andreina	via Buffolareccia 14	Loreto	60025	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,MeatsandGrills	Sixty years after this restaurant was opened by his grandmother Andreina, Errico Recanati continues to add his own distinctive mark to the family business. Following the complete renovation of the farmhouse interior, the dining rooms are even more elegant and welcoming than before. Here, the excellent staff offer attentive and discreet service, while the cuisine, rooted in local traditions, focuses especially on game and grilled dishes. The only features that have survived in the dining room are the grill and the fireplace! Recanati’s distinctive style makes full use of fire, charcoal embers and the afore-mentioned grill and spit: he is a real expert in the latter, enabling delightful grilled flavours and aromas to make their way into most of his dishes, which he often personalises by adding fruit and vegetables from his own garden. All of this contributes to what the chef himself describes as his “neo-rural” style of cuisine, which is beautifully illuminated by new lamps arranged on the tables with the precision of a stage set.

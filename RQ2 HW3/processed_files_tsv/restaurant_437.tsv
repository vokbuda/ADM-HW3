Ora d'Aria	via dei Georgofili 11r	Florence	50122	Italy	€€€	Contemporary	Situated behind the Uffizi, this restaurant boasts a large open-view kitchen and an original approach that focuses on creating meaningful dialogue between guests and the chefs in the kitchen. The restaurant owes its name to the old Florentine Le Murate prison nearby, as well as to its stated aim of providing guests with time to breathe and relax. The dishes here are influenced by Tuscan traditions and Italian cuisine alike yet reinterpreted with a creative touch and a greater emphasis on vegetables. The tasting menus include the Menu Bendato, which features specialities chosen by the chef, and the La Bistecca alla fiorentinaoption (available by prior booking only), on which the famous Florentine steak is presented in different guises. An impressive wine list completes the picture.

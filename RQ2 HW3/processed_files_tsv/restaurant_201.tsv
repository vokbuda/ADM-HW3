Tilia	via Dolomiti 31/b	Toblach	39034	Italy	€€€€	ModernCuisine,Contemporary	This glass and steel cube in the middle of the garden of the former Grand Hotel in Dobbiaco has been home to the Tilia restaurant since 2010 and is now more intimate than ever, with just five tables and seating for 12 diners (booking is highly recommended). Chef Chris Oberhammer’s menu is enticing, featuring just under 20 dishes with a modern yet regional flavour. Many of the ingredients (such as the flour and some of the meat) are sourced from the “Klaude” farm which is run by one of the chef’s childhood friends with whom he works very closely, while other more exotic fare comes from further afield, adding luxury ingredients such as caviar, truffles (in season) and prawns to the mix. Anita Mancini oversees the front of house with skill and professionalism, as well as taking care of the wine list which includes a selection of international labels.

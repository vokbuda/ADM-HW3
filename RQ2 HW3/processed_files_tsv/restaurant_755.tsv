Malga Panna	strada de Sort 64	località Sorte	Moena	38035	€€€	RegionalCuisine,SeasonalCuisine	The story of the Donei family is intertwined with the history of the Alpine farm (“malga”) that was transformed into a restaurant in the 1950s when the parents of the current owner-chef, Paolo, used to prepare delicious dishes for the first holidaymakers to the region. The “malga” is also the symbol of what is now one of the best restaurants in the Fassa valley. All that remains of the “malga” today is its name and the panoramic location above the village and the valley, views of which can be enjoyed from the new veranda dining room decorated in minimalist Alpine style with floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The contemporary, regionally inspired cuisine served here is of high quality, prepared by the skilful owner who is a naturally talented chef. There’s also a tasting menu, which combines Trentino influences with Mediterranean touches. In a nod to the restaurant’s location (on the edge of the woods) and its history, simpler options are also available.

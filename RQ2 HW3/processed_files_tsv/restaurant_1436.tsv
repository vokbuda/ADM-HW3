Osteria della Foce	via Eugenio Ruspoli 72r	Genoa	16129	Italy	€€	Farmtotable,Countrycooking	This simple restaurant stands out for its delicious, authentic cuisine which is influenced by Ligurian and Italian traditions alike. The culinary techniques used are classic, both in its meat dishes (the roast veal is excellent) and fish options (raw fish dishes often feature on the menu). First courses include a home-made bronze-cut pasta (“trafilata al bronzo”) which is served with sauces inspired by whatever is in season or available in the market.

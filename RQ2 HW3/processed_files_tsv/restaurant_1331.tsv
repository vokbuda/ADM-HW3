Harry's Piccolo	piazza Unità d'Italia 2	Trieste	34121	Italy	€€€€	ItalianContemporary,MediterraneanCuisine	Thanks to its hushed ambience, Harry’s Piccolo is an ideal choice for a romantic dinner or a business meal, with fine cuisine prepared by chefs Matteo Metullio and Davide De Pra (Passion Dessert Award 2024). Despite their youth, these two chefs demonstrate plenty of ability and creativity, serving dishes that showcase local meat, fish and seafood, and seasonal vegetables, as well as hints of the Orient, in this elegant setting. Memorable dishes include the tagliatelle with mussel water, saffron, sea urchins and wild fennel, and desserts such as the sesame ice cream with pepper cream and a touch of dashi. The wine list focuses particularly on the region, while also featuring some top-quality labels from outside Italy including a good selection of sparkling wines such as the renowned Krug champagne. Added bonuses are the friendly service, and an outdoor space for an aperitif or after-dinner drink with views of one of Italy’s most beautiful squares.

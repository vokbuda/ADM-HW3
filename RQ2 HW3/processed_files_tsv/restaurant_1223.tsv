Al Malò - Cucina e Miscelazione	piazza Cavour 28	Rovato	25038	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary,Vegetarian	Under the porticoes of the evocative Piazza Cavour you can see the double entrance: the door for the evening cocktail bar on the ground level, while–hidden on the left–there is a lift to the first level where there is the restaurant: the contemporary dining room is animated by bright wallpaper that seems almost to reveal in advance the imaginative cuisine of the chef-patron. Colorful, contemporary, with neat creative presentations he skilfully alternates meat (their signature is tongue mille-feuille, on the menu since the opening in 2019) and fish, but there is no lack of vegetarian dishes. Half portions are available. The fun grows with the mixology option of the cocktail list–in the evening–as well as the good wine list that, ça va sans dire, has great consideration for Franciacorta.

Une	via Fiorenzuola 37	Capodacqua	6034	Italy	€€€	Creative,Umbrian	Situated in the heart of this town nestled amid the Umbrian countryside, Une serves two tasting menus (with varying numbers of courses) which follow the seasons: Acquedotto and Relazioni both feature modern and creative dishes prepared using a whole host of local ingredients. The desserts are absolutely superb – we particularly recommend the namelaka (a soft, delicious cream) with elderberry, the Mundo Novo coffee emulsion, and the date and caper ice cream.

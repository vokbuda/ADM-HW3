Cannavacciuolo by the Lake	Via Legro 33	Pettenasco	28028	Italy	€€€	Contemporary,ModernCuisine	Situated within the elegant Laqua by the Lake boutique hotel (part of the Cannavacciuolo “galaxy”), this restaurant boasts fine lake views to accompany the imaginative Mediterranean cuisine served by resident chef Giovanni Bertone. There are three tasting menus (the lake-inspired “Brezza”; the Neapolitan-influenced “Acquolina”, and a totally vegetarian menu), plus an à la carte option for anyone who wishes to choose their own individual dishes. Our inspector particularly recommends the amberjack, fennel and roe dish, as well as Antonino’s mouthwatering babà dessert.

Dolada	via Dolada 21	località Plois alt. 870	Pieve d'Alpago	32010	€€€	Countrycooking,ModernCuisine	An idyllic picture-postcard setting in a panoramic location overlooking Santa Croce lake, surrounded by villages and mountain peaks. This is matched by an elegant interior with a mix of antique and modern furnishings, and a succession of stylish small dining rooms and lounges, including an open fireplace where many of the ingredients are cooked. For over a century, this restaurant has told the story of the De Pra family and their love for the mountains which is clearly evident in the cuisine served here. Chef Riccardo has strengthened this connection by intensifying his search for local ingredients (game, mushrooms, freshwater fish etc) and cultivating his own kitchen garden and vineyard. The fragrant ingredients are prepared simply yet with technical expertise, with flavour always the primary focus – an infallible recipe for resounding success!

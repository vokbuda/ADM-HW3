San Giorgio	viale Brigate Bisagno 69r	Genoa	16129	Italy	€€€	ModernCuisine,Ligurian	Situated in the city albeit not right in the centre, San Giorgio is a typical Genovese restaurant – elegant and classic in style, with excellent cuisine served by the Scala family who have been in charge for decades. Young chef Samuele Di Mauro is at the helm, having started here as an apprentice and worked his way to the position of sous-chef and then head chef in 2022. Despite a focus on modern presentation and techniques, as demonstrated in dishes such as the raw bluefin tuna seasoned with an intense verbena mousse and served with caper cream and a “caviar” of dried and fried tuna, his cuisine is Mediterranean in style, with its roots in Ligurian aromas and flavours. The wine list is as impressive as the cuisine, with an entire section dedicated to French and Italian sparkling wines.

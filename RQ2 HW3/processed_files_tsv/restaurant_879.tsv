Modì	via Bucceri	Torregrotta	98050	Italy	€€€	Sicilian,Contemporary	This restaurant has moved from its previous location in central Torregrotta to a more secluded setting slightly above the town centre, where it aims to offer its guests an even better dining experience. The owner-chef has more than achieved this, serving excellent Sicilian dishes reinterpreted with careful precision and a contemporary twist. A good wine list completes the picture.

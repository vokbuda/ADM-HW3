San Domenico	via Sacchi 1	Imola	40026	Italy	€€€€	ClassicCuisine	Although the kitchens have been recently updated with the latest equipment and a chef's table (“Saletta 22”) which allows guests to admire the chefs at work, San Domenico has retained its timeless charm – from the almost English-style ambience of its dining rooms to the outdoor tables overlooking an attractive square with public gardens in the historic centre. This setting provides the perfect backdrop for Massimiliano Mascia’s cuisine, which includes a selection of local and Italian dishes, all prepared simply, without excessive frills and with a focus on flavour and guest satisfaction that avoids modern trends. The extensive wine list offers an array of excellent labels, including a section dedicated exclusively to rare bottles produced before 1985!

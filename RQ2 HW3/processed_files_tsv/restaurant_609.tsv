Iyo	via Piero della Francesca 74	Milan	20154	Italy	€€€€	Japanese,AsianContemporary	After significant refurbishment, this restaurant now has a completely new look – its black marble has been replaced by a more contemporary colour scheme that gives it a more international feel, while still maintaining a minimalism that is typically Japanese. At the entrance, guests are greeted by a small lounge and a long open-view kitchen where numerous sushi chefs can be seen at work, which then leads to a dining room decorated in soft, relaxing colours and furnished with striking round tables made from Patagonian marble. The extensive à la carte features all the classic dishes you would expect of a Japanese restaurant, including well-known versions of sushi, sashimi and tempura, alongside more creative fusion recipes which combine influences from Japan, Europe and elsewhere. There’s also an excellent selection of around 500 wines, including the option of ordering wine by the glass.

La Caravella dal 1959	via Matteo Camera 12	Amalfi	84011	Italy	€€€€	Campanian,MediterraneanCuisine	La Caravella’s history is intricately linked to that of gastronomic tourism on the Amalfi Coast, so much so that it’s impossible to mention all the famous personalities who have dined here and fallen in love with the Dipino family’s cuisine. The food is proudly inspired by local and family traditions, while at the same time constantly seeking to reinterpret these traditions and create new imaginative recipes. Examples include pears cooked in Aglianico wine served with raw shrimps and cow’s ricotta cheese, and raw fish and seafood options accompanied by a careful selection of seasonal vegetables. Two important features here are the focus on simple, traditional cooking techniques and the speed of preparation. The menu showcases the best of the area’s fresh fish, including pezzogna (a variety of sea bream), swordfish and tuna, supplemented when necessary by options from the nearby Cilento region. Other ingredients include tomatoes (which feature in almost half the dishes), Amalfi’s famous lemons (the classic lemon soufflé is highly recommended), basil and Agerola bread – you’ll want to order almost everything on the menu! The excellent wine list features reds, whites, sparkling, sweet, young and vintage wines, with legendary labels such as La Tâche listed alongside smaller, unknown, rare and organic wines. Whatever your preference, sommelier Tonino has that rare talent (also found at the Enoteca Pinchiorri) of finding just the right wine for you.

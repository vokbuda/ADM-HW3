La Notizia 53	via Caravaggio 53/55	Naples	80126	Italy	€	Pizza	Although situated away from the tourist centre, Enzo Coccia’s pizzeria continues to be considered one of the best places for pizza in Campania. Featuring classic Neapolitan pizzas with soft, stringy dough, the menu offers traditional and creative toppings alike. The “'mpustarella”, a five-grain and wholemeal flour roll with different fillings, more than compensates for the lack of “fritti” on the menu. The first historic restaurant at number 53 has now been joined by a second address at number 94/a nearby.

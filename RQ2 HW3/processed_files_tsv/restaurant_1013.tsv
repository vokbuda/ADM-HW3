Lorelei	via Aniello Califano 4	Sorrento	80067	Italy	€€€€	MediterraneanCuisine	Even if the weather isn’t kind and you can’t eat outdoors, make sure you have an aperitif or perhaps just take a look at the terrace with its stunning views of the Bay of Naples, especially at sunset. Once the sun has set, enjoy dishes prepared by chef Ciro Sicignano, who hails from Gragnano and who showcases the specialities of Campania to perfection. The region’s traditional recipes and ingredients are reinterpreted with energy and imagination, with a focus on vegetables (which the chef sources from two kitchen gardens) and a dedicated olive oil menu. The elegant setting of the Lorelei Londres hotel adds to the appeal.

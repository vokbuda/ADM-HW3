Ai Campi di Marcello	via Napoli 11	Monfalcone	34074	Italy	€€	Seafood	Not far from the shipyards, simple but pleasant atmosphere in a family-run restaurant with good seafood options. Among the many specialties, we recommend the cold soup with raw and cooked fish. Curious note: the owner's passion for rum translates into an intriguing and unexpected selection of this liqueur.

Bis Osteria Italiana Contemporanea	Via 20 Settembre 50	Colle di Val d'Elsa	53034	Italy	€€	SeasonalCuisine,Tuscan	In the glorious premises of the old Arnolfo restaurant in the old town, this restaurant is run by the same management as previously, although with a new young chef at the helm in the kitchen. The delicious yet concise menu features “Italian specialities” (the name given to all the main courses) with a focus on meat and fish, accompanied by excellent bread options (you can even order “scarpetta” dipping bread for mopping up the remains of a Cinta Senese pork sauce). The house speciality is a delicious pigeon dish. In fine weather, guests can dine on the beautiful, tranquil terrace.

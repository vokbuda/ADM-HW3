Ling's Ravioleria Migrante	via Leandro Alberti 34/2c	Bologna	40137	Italy	€	Asian,Fusion	A young couple (she was born in China; he’s half-French, half-Italian) have settled in this quiet residential district where they now run a tiny yet successful restaurant with around 20 seats in the dining room and a few small tables outdoors in summer – booking is essential! The menu includes various types of Chinese ravioli as well as dishes described by the couple as “migrant”, in other words “which draw inspiration from different cuisines from around the world, not only Asia but also the Mediterranean, France and Italy, with Emilia Romagna at its heart”. Examples include Peking-styleMora Romagnola coppa ham and pink Adriatic prawns marinated in mirin and soy sauce. The menu changes daily in line with market availability and the inspiration of the chef. Drinks include tea, beer and a small selection of wine.

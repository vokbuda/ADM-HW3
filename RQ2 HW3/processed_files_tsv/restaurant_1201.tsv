Vignamare	strada Castello	20 - Colla Micheri	Andora	17051	€€€€	ModernCuisine,Farmtotable	From Andora, head uphill along a winding road, then leave the car in the car park and follow a path through the vineyards to get to this restaurant, where meals are served either on a panoramic terrace (in fine weather) or indoors in a modern, wood-furnished dining room. Wherever you choose, the regionally influenced cuisine (often with a focus on vegetables) is extraordinary, with many ingredients grown or produced on the property. There are three tasting menus of various lengths, all of which showcase Ligurian cuisine. Similarly, the wine is sourced exclusively from the restaurant’s own estate.

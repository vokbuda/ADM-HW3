Mangiare Bere Uomo Donna	viale Zonta 19	Suzzara	46029	Italy	€	Fusion,RegionalCuisine	She’s from Hong Kong, while he’s from Suzzara – together this couple run this welcoming restaurant where their international focus extends from the dishes which feature on the menu to the wine selection and the couple’s love for applied arts. Once seated, you can either choose traditional fare, including a few delicious fish dishes, or you can be tempted by the decidedly Asian options. Whatever you decide, one thing’s for sure – authenticity and seasonal, locally sourced ingredients are guaranteed.

Il Pievano	Località Spaltenna 13	Gaiole in Chianti	53013	Italy	€€€€	Countrycooking,ModernCuisine	Occupying the charming, romantic setting of a thousand-year-old monastery, this restaurant serves meals either in its Sala dei Papi dining room or at tables arranged in a delightful inner courtyard. Either way, you’re in the capable hands of young chef Stelios Sakalis who originally hails from Greece. He offers three tasting menus (one is a surprise menu) on which Tuscan and Greek traditions are reinterpreted with a contemporary look and flavour. We particularly enjoyed the many delicious starters, as well as the acorn-flour buttons with red prawns (saganaki) and the excellent pastry desserts. Make sure you try the Cantina del Castello wines which are made from the restaurant’s own grapes.

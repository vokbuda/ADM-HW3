Makorè	via Palestro 10	Ferrara	44121	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary,Seafood	Makorè’s new gourmet venture offers guests a delightful dining experience where the focus is on vegetables, as well as fish from the adjacent fishmongers. The chef demonstrates his culinary skills and techniques on three surprise tasting menus (of different lengths) and an à la carte, featuring dishes such as the familiar yet far from ordinary grilled squid (with a fragrant tuna and stracciatella stuffing) and a selection of boiled fish including cod tongue, ventresca tuna, tuna and cuttlefish sausage, gurnard, giardiniera vegetables and potatoes. We asked the excellent sommelier for recommendations and enjoyed a deep-gold Abate wine made from red Fortana grapes in line with local tradition. An elegant restaurant that has really made its mark in Ferrara.

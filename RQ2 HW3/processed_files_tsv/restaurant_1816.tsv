Pescheria	corso Giuseppe Garibaldi 227	Salerno	84122	Italy	€€€	Seafood,Italian	The name of this restaurant between the historic centre and the seafront refers to the main item on its menu, which is dedicated almost exclusively to fish (fresh and not farmed). Fish and shellfish are displayed in a glass cabinet and aquarium respectively, both of which are situated to the rear of the long, narrow dining room near the open-view kitchen. Classic fish dishes full of flavour (served raw, baked, cooked in salt, in water or grilled) are to the fore here.

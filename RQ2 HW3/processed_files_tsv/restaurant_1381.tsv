Unforgettable	via Lorenzo Valerio 5/b	Turin	10122	Italy	€€€€	Innovative,ItalianContemporary	Although it seems incredible today, this restaurant in central Turin, situated just a stone’s throw from the Santuario della Consolata, stands on a street that once marked the boundary between the town and the surrounding countryside – to highlight the fact, after ringing the doorbell you make your way into what was once a farmhouse. Despite this traditional setting, chef Christian Mandura’s focus here is creative and occasionally extremely imaginative with dishes presented on a long tasting menu inspired by his varied experience. Having been greeted by the chefs in the kitchen, guests are then served at a counter where they sit side by side (there are ten seats in total). Vegetables take centre stage in Mandura’s dishes, with fish and meat usually served as an accompaniment, although if you prefer a menu based exclusively on one type of meat you can book the Paradigma dining room. There is also an original and personalised selection of drinks by the glass (not just wine) sourced by sommelier Jacopo from small-scale producers, including an excellent choice of vermouths.

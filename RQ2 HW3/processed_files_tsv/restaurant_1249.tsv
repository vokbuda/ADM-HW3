His excellent cuisine includes regional influences with a hint of exotic flavour in dishes that are balanced, harmonious and often original without becoming excessively extravagant. The restaurant occupies the first floor of the luxury San Barbato Resort, which has a strong and committed approach to sustainable resource management. The modern, spacious dining room overlooks the illuminated fountain in the hotel garden.

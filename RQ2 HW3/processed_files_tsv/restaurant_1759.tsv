sui generis.	via Roma 35	Saronno	21047	Italy	€€€€	Creative	A modern dining-room with an open-view kitchen where young Alfio Nicolosi can be observed at work, ably assisted by friendly and attentive staff front of house. When you book, you’ll be asked if you have any food allergies or intolerances, or any ingredients that you don’t like, as there is just one surprise tasting menu served here. The truly extraordinary dishes are inspired by the chef’s remarkable knowledge of culinary traditions from Italy and further afield (strong Asian and South American influences are obvious), resulting in highly personalised dishes. Nicolosi is one of the most interesting young chefs in Italy at the moment and his exciting cuisine is full of intense flavours, including grilled dishes with a hint of street food and other influences apparent throughout.

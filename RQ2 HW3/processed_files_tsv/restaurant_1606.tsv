Dattilo	Contrada Dattilo	Strongoli	88816	Italy	€€€€	Countrycooking,Creative	In a world of haute cuisine still dominated by male chefs, Caterina Ceraudo stands out for her authoritative presence and large personality. Her restaurant is housed in a charming agriturismo which offers simple guestrooms decorated in attractive, rustic style, a beautiful swimming pool shaded by thousand-year-old olive trees, and traditional produce such as wine, olive oil, cedro and orange marmalades, and fruit juices. All of this provides a fitting backdrop for Caterina’s modern, creative and yet unfussy cuisine which is made using local ingredients and showcased on two tasting menus and a fixed-price à la carte. The tour of the property with owner Roberto (the chef’s father), a forerunner of organic agriculture in the region who, together with his family, has dedicated his life to this farm, is both instructive and enjoyable.

Indaco	piazza Santa Restituta 1	Lacco Ameno	80076	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Seafood	Although the sun sets behind you at this restaurant, the sky takes on beautiful indigo hues at dusk (hence the name Indaco), so it’s well worth getting here for sunset. Overlooking a small bay at the Regina Isabella hotel, the restaurant boasts sweeping views of Lacco Ameno, Casamicciola, the island of Procida, Vesuvius and Bacoli, all of which unfold in front of your eyes with the sea like a bay enclosed by the islands – an unforgettable sight! At the helm in the kitchen, Pasquale Palamaro from Ischia serves elaborate and creative dishes inspired by his childhood memories, all showcased on two tasting menus (fish takes centre stage although a few meat dishes also feature) from which dishes can also be chosen individually à la carte style. The wine is of the highest quality, both in terms of the extensive selection (more than 1 000 labels) and the recommendations provided by the enthusiastic sommelier.

Equilibrio	località Martin 13	Dolcedo	18020	Italy	€€€	Ligurian,Contemporary	Consumed by a passion for cooking, young Jacopo Chieppa began his career working with sweet and savoury leavened products and gaining experience in renowned restaurants such as the Mirazur in Menton and Antica Corona Reale in Cervere. He has now opened his own restaurant in an old restored mill, where he serves exciting, delicious cuisine that is contemporary in style yet traditional in its ingredients, some of which are grown in the property’s own kitchen garden next door. We particularly enjoyed the playful (and tasty) opening “picnic”, as well as the mupa (a type of fish) served with asparagus and a clam and parmesan emulsion. Front of house, the chef’s wife Melania displays an equal passion for her work, while in summer there’s an attractive outdoor space for alfresco dining.

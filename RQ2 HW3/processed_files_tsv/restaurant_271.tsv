L'Argine a Vencò	Località Vencò 15	Dolegna del Collio	34070	Italy	€€€€	Countrycooking,Creative	This perfectly restored old mill is home to a chef who creates original cuisine that demonstrates her connection with her region and showcases ingredients grown in the restaurant’s own kitchen garden, especially the aromatic herbs that are a characteristic feature of many of the dishes served here. Antonia Klugmann’s house stands in attractive unspoilt scenery near the Slovenian border and in the middle of two major wine-producing areas, namely the Colli Orientali del Friuli and the better-known Collio, both of which are well represented on the extensive wine list.

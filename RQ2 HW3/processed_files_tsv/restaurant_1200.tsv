Terra The Magic Place	località Prati 21	Sarentino	39058	Italy	€€€€	Creative,RegionalCuisine	At the end of the long uphill road through the woods, there is Terra, a magical place in a fairy-tale landscape, where you can enjoy a romantic and refined atmosphere combining the tradition of wood with modern elements, such as the wine cellar suspended over the room. The patron Heinrich Schneider has become a great chef starting out from being self taught. Study and application, together with a great love for and attachment to the mountains, did the rest. The gastronomic experience is offered through a single organized tasting menu in which, with a good pace, you can enjoy little masterpieces of aesthetics and taste. The locally sourced beef is splendid: a double tasting based on braised meat with a glaze of garbanzo beans, stellaria and liquid gnocchi, potatoes and charcoal-grilled tenderloin with a glaze of spices, pimpernel oil and scorzonera. For the wines, you need only trust in the completeness of the list (alcohol-free wines too) and the enthusiastic expertise of Gisela, the chef's sister. Being in a rather isolated position, you may like to take advantage of the exclusive private resort that completes a truly unique experience.

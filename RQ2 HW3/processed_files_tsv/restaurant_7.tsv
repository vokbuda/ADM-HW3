Donevandro	via Garibaldi 2	Popoli	65026	Italy	€€	Contemporary,SeasonalCuisine	Up until a few years ago, the owner-chef at this restaurant was working as a painter – a fact that is evident from the artistic touch in his cuisine. His recipes are modern and personalised, with careful attention naturally paid to harmonious presentation, while the flavour of his dishes is brought out by ingredients that are skilfully chosen from the Abruzzo inland area. In 2024, the restaurant moved to new, centrally located premises which have an intimate feel and are elegant and minimalist in style.

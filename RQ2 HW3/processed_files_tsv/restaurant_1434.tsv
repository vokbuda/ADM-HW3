Novo Osteria	piazza De Cristoforis 30	Borgonovo Val Tidone	29011	Italy	€€€	Contemporary,RegionalCuisine	Originally a monastery, this building dating back to the 11C was later transformed into an inn. Having closed at the beginning of this century, the building has now been fully renovated and restored to its original function, while retaining much of its original architecture. In addition to the restaurant, which serves traditional local cuisine with a modern focus and plenty of flavour (we particularly enjoyed the savoury zabaglione gnocchi with porcini mushrooms, Jerusalem artichokes and currants), there are also seven guestrooms available in the adjoining Locanda Borgo Impero.

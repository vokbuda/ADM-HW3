Tancredi	via XXV Aprile 75	Sirmione	25019	Italy	€€€	Creative	Having trained with Antonino Cannavacciuolo, young chef Vincenzo Manicone has, with his wife Sara, embarked on a new venture in this elegant restaurant with a glass-fronted dining room and a terrace suspended between the lake and the sky. Showcased on tasting menus and an à la carte, the chef’s cuisine demonstrates a maturity that pays close attention to colour and flavour, with beautifully presented dishes prepared from top-quality, well-balanced ingredients. Also evident is the aim, currently in vogue, of reducing food waste by using every single part of the animal (as in the case of the excellent amberjack, curly salad and sea urchin dish that we very much enjoyed). In summer, we recommend requesting a table at the front of the terrace, right over the lake.

Apollonia	via Sant'Apollonia 3	località Sirmiano Sopra	Nals	39010	€€	RegionalCuisine,TraditionalCuisine	Following a road that twists and turns uphill, surrounded at first by vineyards and fruit trees and then by woodland, you climb to an altitude of 900m to reach this restaurant run by the Geiser family, who have been serving simple yet delicious regional (and Italian) cuisine here for three generations. With a focus on seasonal ingredients from the Alto Adige, the restaurant’s emblematic dish is Val Passiria char with Termeno polenta and Sirmiano saffron. The beautiful views take in Terlano in the middle of the valley and the majestic Dolomites (including Sciliar, Catinaccio and Latemar) in the distance.

Boivin	via Garibaldi 9	Levico Terme	38056	Italy	€€	RegionalCuisine,SeasonalCuisine	Occupying an old house in the town centre, this restaurant is strongly influenced by the character and ideas of owner-chef Riccardo Bosco, who offers an original mix of traditional Trento cuisine and influences from around the world, including Korean kimchi and Japanese cooking methods such as tataki. A prime example of the latter is one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, namely trout with celeriac purée. Daily specials based on what’s available at the market also feature, while regional wines are to the fore on the wine list.

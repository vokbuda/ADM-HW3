Spoon	via Mario Capuani 61	Teramo	64100	Italy	€€	CuisinefromAbruzzo,Contemporary	Located in the heart of the historic centre, just a stone’s throw from the beautiful 13C cathedral, this small, simple restaurant with an outdoor space is home to owner-chef Marco Cozzi, whose cuisine is the main attraction here. Having trained with Niko Romito, this chef creates dishes from seasonal, regional ingredients, reinterpreting traditional recipes to give them a contemporary flavour (for example, he transforms pancotto into a cream of bread and Navelli saffron, which he then crowns with Robiola cheese, cime di rapa and triangles of cured pork loin). His two tasting menus focus entirely on meat and feature an impressive selection of vegetables.

Uliassi	banchina di Levante 6	Senigallia	60019	Italy	€€€€	Creative,Seafood	The Adriatic Riviera, a perfect picture-postcard summer holiday destination, is the setting for this fine restaurant run by chef Mauro Uliassi. Hidden among the private beach clubs that crowd Senigallia’s seafront, this three-Michelin-star restaurant comes as a surprise, surrounded as it is by beach parasols and the sound of the sea lapping on the shore. The strength and originality of Uliassi’s cuisine lies in his ability to make good use of local ingredients, taking inspiration from the culinary traditions that have been so familiar and successful along this coastline over the past few decades and giving them a personal, creative twist. Fish and seafood obviously take pride of place, although there’s also room on the menu for meat, inspired by the Marche’s traditional game dishes – the delicious skewered pigeon is cooked to perfection! The colourful dining experience here is enhanced by the owner’s warm welcome, with Mauro’s sister Catia and his son Filippo working alongside the chef. It’s also worth mentioning that the restaurant has a keen focus on the environment, hence its banning of the use of plastic and doing its utmost to persuade its fish suppliers not to use polystyrene to transport their fish.

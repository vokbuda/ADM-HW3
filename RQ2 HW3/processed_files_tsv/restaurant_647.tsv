Casa D'Angelo	via San Nicola 5	Fara Filiorum Petri	66010	Italy	€€	CuisinefromAbruzzo,SeasonalCuisine	Housed in what was once an old family home, this elegant restaurant serves delicious regional cuisine. The menu includes dishes that have been skilfully and imaginatively enhanced by the chef, such as warm pheasant terrine with apple, alongside more traditional fare, from cured ham to charcoal-grilled local lamb and potato gnocchi with a duck sauce. The restaurant’s own extra-virgin olive oil often adds further flavour to the dishes. The 4-course tasting menu deserves a special mention for its excellent value for money.

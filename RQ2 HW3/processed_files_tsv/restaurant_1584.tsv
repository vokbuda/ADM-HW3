Amanõ	via Sidney Sonnino 68	Cagliari	9125	Italy	€€	Contemporary	The tilde accent over the “o” in the name of this restaurant is a subtle allusion to the sea that lies between Campania (the chef’s native region) and Sardinia (his adopted home). With just a few tables and an open-view kitchen, the dining room here is adorned with hand-made decorations, hence the name of the restaurant (“a mano” means “by hand”). The chef makes full use of Sardinian ingredients in his elaborate and creative cuisine, so this is a good choice for anyone seeking a change from traditional fare.

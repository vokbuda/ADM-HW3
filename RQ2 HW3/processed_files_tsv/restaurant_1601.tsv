Stilla	Località Casette 1	Colognola ai Colli	37030	Italy	€€	Contemporary	Run by an enthusiastic and committed young couple who left the big city to restore the family home and transform it into an elegant, welcoming restaurant, Stilla stands in a tranquil location surrounded by vineyards. Here, Silvia creates original, generous and colourful cuisine which is showcased on an à la carte with just a few dishes which change regularly. We particularly enjoyed the freshly seared bonito served with wild spinach, sour cherries and a cherry barbecue sauce. Meals are served on the outdoor terrace in summer. Accommodation is also available in five beautiful yet functional guestrooms. Well worth a visit.

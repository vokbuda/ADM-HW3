Battipalo	viale Vittorio Veneto 2	Lesa	28040	Italy	€€	ModernCuisine	A young couple opened this attractive restaurant next to the ferry dock some years ago. The large windows offer romantic views of the lake, while the distinctly modern cuisine focuses on meat and fish alike. Excellent care has been taken in selecting the wine list. There is also a pleasant outdoor area for alfresco dining.

Alto	via Circondariale San Francesco 2	Fiorano Modenese	41042	Italy	€€€	Creative	"The top floor of the renovated Executive Spa Hotel now houses chef Mattia Trabetti’s fine-dining restaurant, where the rooftop dining room boasts relaxing views of the surrounding hills and the Santuario della Beata Vergine del Castello through its floor-to-ceiling windows. The young, innovative cuisine is showcased on a “green” tasting menu (Emilia Vegetale) with a seasonal and regional focus, as well as on a menu dedicated to local traditions (Modena Safari). Original options that will appeal to curious palates include trout with alchermes, cat fish and hops; green tagliatelle with chicory, black garlic and roe (with grated egg adding an interesting twist); and Montese-style duck. The wine list offers plenty of choice, starting with a regional focus but also extending to the rest of Italy and then to France. We particularly recommend the Giorgio Melandri Sangiovese di Romagna ""Acereta"" with its balanced aromas, which offers excellent value for money."

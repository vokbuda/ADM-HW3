Al Convento - Casa Torrente	piazza San Francesco 16	Cetara	84010	Italy	€€	Campanian,MediterraneanCuisine	Following renovation work, the frescoed dining room at this restaurant now has the feel of a contemporary osteria, while its attractive terrace boasts tables overlooking the picturesque village’s small square. The menu focuses mainly on fish and seafood (although a few meat options such as tomahawk ribeye and steak also feature), including raw fish, tartares, fried anchovies stuffed with smoked provolone cheese, grilled dishes, and pasta including spaghetti with the local anchovy sauce. If you choose fish from the dry ageing cabinet, you’ll add a little extra to your bill.

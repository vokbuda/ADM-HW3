Impronta	via Angarano 7	Bassano del Grappa	36061	Italy	€€€	ItalianContemporary	Located right next to the Ponte Vecchio, the symbol of Bassano del Grappa, this restaurant boasts an elegant, almost Alpine decor with soft lighting and a minimalist feel. In summer, our advice is to book one of the few tables on the outdoor terrace with its views of the famous bridge and the River Brenta (book well in advance!). Modern cuisine with a regional influence, as well as the occasional fish and seafood option.
